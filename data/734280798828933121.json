Participants: 1009 health care workers who provided direct care to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Intervention: Use of medical masks versus fit-tested N95 respirators for 10 weeks, plus universal masking, which was the policy implemented at each site. Measurements: The primary outcome was confirmed COVID-19 on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.

disenrolment if unvaccinated. To assess the appropriateness of booster mandates in this age group, we combine empirical risk-benefit assessment and ethical analysis. To prevent one COVID-19 hospitalisation over a 6-month period, we estimate that 31\u2009207\u201342\u2009836 young adults aged 18\u201329 years must receive a third mRNA vaccine. Booster mandates in young adults are expected to cause a net harm: per COVID-19 hospitalisation prevented, we anticipate at least 18.5 serious adverse events from mRNA vaccines, including 1.5\u20134.6 booster-associated myopericarditis cases in males (typically requiring hospitalisation). We also anticipate 1430\u20134626 cases of grade \u22653 reactogenicity interfering with daily activities (although typically not requiring hospitalisation).

increased healthcare worker (HCW) influenza vaccination. This evidence has led to expansive policies of enforcement that include all staff of acute care hospitals and other healthcare settings beyond LTCFs. We critique and quantify the cRCT evidence for indirect patient benefit underpinning policies of mandatory HCW influenza vaccination. Methods Plausibility of the four cRCT findings attributing indirect patient benefits to HCW influenza vaccination was assessed by comparing percentage reductions in patient risk reported by the cRCTs to predicted values. Plausibly predicted values were derived according to the basic mathematical principle of dilution, taking into account HCW influenza vaccine coverage and the specificity of patient outcomes for influenza.

While these policies have prompted ethical, scientific, practical, legal and political debate, there has been limited evaluation of their potential unintended consequences. Here, we outline a comprehensive set of hypotheses for why these policies may ultimately be counterproductive and harmful. Our framework considers four domains: (1) behavioural psychology, (2) politics and law, (3) socioeconomics, and (4) the integrity of science and public health. While current vaccines appear to have had a significant impact on decreasing COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality burdens, we argue that current mandatory vaccine policies are scientifically questionable and are likely to cause more societal harm than good.

Objective: To estimate changes in population immunity against infection and severe disease due to circulating SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants in the United States from December 2021 to October 2022, and to quantify the protection against a potential 2022-2023 winter SARS-CoV-2 wave. Design, setting, participants: Bayesian evidence synthesis of reported COVID-19 data (diagnoses, hospitalizations), vaccinations, and waning patterns for vaccine- and infection-acquired immunity, using a mathematical model of COVID-19 natural history. Main Outcomes and Measures: Population immunity against infection and severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 ", "unwound_url": "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.19.22282525v1"}, {"start": 246, "end": 269, "url": "https://t.co/FlY9MqC3Jq", "expanded_url": "https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1594726039393296385/photo/1", "display_url": "pic.twitter.com/FlY9MqC3Jq", "media_key": "3_1594725344145088512"}, {"start": 246, "end": 269, "url": "https://t.co/FlY9MqC3Jq", "expanded_url": "https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1594726039393296385/photo/1", "display_url": "pic.twitter.com/FlY9MqC3Jq", "media_key": "3_1594725523384475651"}], "mentions": [{"start": 230, "end": 245, "username": "HarvardChanSPH", "id": "42651647"}]}, "created_at": "2022-11-21T16:14:51.000Z", "edit_history_tweet_ids": ["1594726039393296385"], "text": "As of 10 November 2022, it is estimated that 94% of Americans have had Covid at least once, much of those infections in the past year.

Objective To determine whether enigmatic SARS-CoV-2 lineages detected in wastewater have a human or non-human (i.e., animal) source. Design On January 11, 2022, an unusual Spike sequence was detected in municipal wastewater from a metropolitan area. Over the next four months, more focused wastewater sampling resolved the source of this variant.
