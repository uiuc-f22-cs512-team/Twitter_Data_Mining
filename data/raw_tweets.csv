"Even if the answer is only on the order of 1%, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere."
Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?

"Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money :)"
Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
@MaxMBerger The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
"Me &amp; other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years, got IPO+ govt money for 3, now paid back. Yes, carbon tax would be a better way."
"@grayj_ There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years, just like we do a census."

"The flight grid fins look like the ones on this test we did, but larger:  https://t.co/gTaURQQeyx"
@ID_AA_Carmack No choice. Entry velocity too high for a precision landing with N2 thrusters alone. Must have aero surfaces for pitch trim.
@John_Gardi Using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign &amp; more data. Maybe flight 21.

@Nezheim @jbmeicher sure :)
.@jbmeicher Model S works great in cold. Highest sales/capita are in Norway and we have a ton of customers in Canada.
"But when considering savings of gas v electricity, true cost vs gas cars is more like $25k for a v sweet ride"
.@benmacy $30k in 2013 $ (ie + inflation) w 200+ mile range w some really cool tech that we can't talk about yet.
".@joshj777 It has always been my dream to produce a low cost, compelling electric car. We are 3 to 4 years away. Wish it could be sooner."
@malkosh was this in a test drive car (those are all about to be upgraded) or a current customer car?

@Scott_Helme can't always detect babies and pets
Can be turned on or off. V8.1 will allow always-on min and max temps to be set.
Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin &amp; turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
This is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to V7.

"Support &amp; advice from @NASA, @FAA, @AFPAA &amp; others much appreciated. Please email any recordings of the event to report@spacex.com."
Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.

"@MrBoylan Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of 2 will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are 2, so speculation unlikely."
@erothenberg Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.

"If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."

"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating."

Can be turned on or off. V8.1 will allow always-on min and max temps to be set.
Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin &amp; turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.

Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
"@elonmusk F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg"
"@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers."
@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
@elonmusk Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
"@mattyteare Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin."

"@MrBoylan Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of 2 will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are 2, so speculation unlikely."
@erothenberg Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.

"Even if the answer is only on the order of 1%, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere."
Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?

"Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money :)"
Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
@MaxMBerger The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
"Me &amp; other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years, got IPO+ govt money for 3, now paid back. Yes, carbon tax would be a better way."
"@grayj_ There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years, just like we do a census."

"@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard It’s embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant"
"@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard You def don’t want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need 100,000 horsepower per engine. That’s not a typo."

"@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel &amp; we’re using a different alloy mix. I super ♥️ 300 Series Stainless!"
"@Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design"

@Robotbeat @michaelknaepen @ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Exactly
"@Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume."
"@MattRemp Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees."
"@martinengwicht @realkrauswife Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces."
"@ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they’re right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."
"@FredericLambert @boringcompany You’re right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn’t include it. We’re working on one that makes things clear."
"@realkrauswife Pop up, park and walk!"
@realkrauswife I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.
"If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy"

Next step for @BoringCompany Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).
@joshjob42 @flaneur @boringcompany Precisely
Presentation starting at 8:15
"@CasPiancey @boringcompany This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go"
"The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start"
"@flaneur @boringcompany Actually way more capacity, way faster &amp; way more convenient. Subways are fine, but it’s time to upgrade to something better."
All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists
"Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city."

"@universal_sci No, we’re just going to accelerate BFR"
@YoBigBrotha Yes
"Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster"
Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
"@scottymeuk @ScaleyMurrsuit No, it’s got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered."
"@FredericLambert @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast"
"@tsrandall @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output."
"@frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit Lot on our plate, so it’s either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster."
@frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit Ok
@ScaleyMurrsuit Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That’s a great van. We will inquire.
@WillFealey Absolutely agree

@SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert I believe it’s $5k
@SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
@j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Somewhere between 500% &amp; 2000%
"@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU."
"@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude."

@martyeuler @MebFaber Fair point 😀
"@MebFaber When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they’re just “passive” managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!"
"@MebFaber Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative — it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide.  https://t.co/7jk2Bs56HR"

"@annerajb @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman The big funds can &amp; will, as they’re suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for “passive” index tracking."
"@dlauer @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder"
"@KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return."
"@KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators"

"@LanceUlanoff Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good."
@LanceUlanoff Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at  https://t.co/CftQ1v9YCL
"@LanceUlanoff Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric."
@martinengwicht @BlondesE A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car

@ArkadiuszKula @JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Good idea
"@JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack."
@LittleMissFlint You’re welcome. Happy birthday! 🎁🎉🎂
"@MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about in that tweet — double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying."
@williamwinters @austinhopperrrr @maysacha @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.
@jeremysliew It’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
"@siwgrindaker @erikveen Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
@erikveen I would def recommend this
@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
@bonnienorman @TeslaBull @trippedover Interesting
"@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Great, thanks"
@JamesWorldSpace Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
"@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water won’t come in"
"@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
@JamesWorldSpace SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
"@JamesWorldSpace Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit."
"@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power."
@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
"@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you’re in an air tube, time doesn’t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
@JamesWorldSpace Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.

"@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number?"
"@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target."

@TeslaCharts How big is your short position? Just curious.
@BobbieBees @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. This one guy’s claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
"@doctorow I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right."
"@dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow UAW doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they’re getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps."
"@TheSithSeth @doctorow I’m not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can’t compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don’t want Tesla to die too."

@ElecVehicleGuy @EVNewsDaily @Tesla Model 3 was designed for min engineering &amp; tooling change for RHD. Note left/right symmetry. LHD for Europe &amp; Asia first half of next year. RHD probably middle of next year.
@EVNewsDaily @Tesla This is the new production line for battery module Zone 4. Will play a key role in getting from 3000/week to 6000/week for Model 3.
@erinbiba I have never attacked science. Definitely attacked misleading journalism like yours though.
"@chick_in_kiev @evepeyser @broderick Pravda was incorporated a year ago. Also, Tesla factory safety has improved every year &amp; is now better than industry avg. Misleading articles refer to Tesla being worse than avg in 2015 when we were just figuring things out."
@nilgirian Worth a shot
@evepeyser @broderick Of course! (Prav)Duh. It is named after the most pernicious propaganda machine in history specifically to highlight what we want to avoid. It’s called “satire” …
"@evepeyser @broderick This is going to help journalism, not harm it. Please be so kind as to hold your fire until you actually see it."

@amywestervelt @Billsocalif @RMac18 @weinbergersa I’ve just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest &amp; yet believe that same public is too stupid &amp; immoral to assess their credibility. It’s amazing that you don’t understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.
@spacecom @amywestervelt @weinbergersa The Tesla facility is open plan &amp; we’re not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well &amp; they are some of the worst &amp; best human beings I’ve ever met. You’re the former.
@ObviousParadox @medickinson @thephysicsgirl No

"@amywestervelt @weinbergersa Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world &amp; products that haven’t been unveiled yet. You don’t have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches."
"@weinbergersa Wow, you’re ignorant. Don’t remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law &amp; land you in jail. I didn’t review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please."

"Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media."
@PassionPlanet1 @supernovaslight @lexiheft @dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don’t realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
"@lexiheft @dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt."

@meharris 🤗
"@ParkerMolloy I’ve never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived &amp; gave people back their jobs. They haven’t forgotten UAW betrayed them. That’s why UAW can’t even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote."
@meharris Of course
"@scottwww @JessicaHuseman It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla &amp; millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but we’re doing our best to make clean energy real &amp; be a good company."
"@JessicaHuseman @reveal No, they’re just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously"
@iShashankBhatia Will do
Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
@scotch_io That’s why editors are included too
@SophieWarnes We don’t. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
"Even if some of the public doesn’t care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors &amp; publications will. It is how they define themselves."
@DetroitVictoria Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
@AntVenom Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
"@Virtualanom Not only needs to be botproof, but seek &amp; unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army"
@sakiwebo Exactly
"Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda …"
@dancow @WSJ An exception that proves the rule
"@CodyBrown Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?"
"Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers."
@teddymonacelli The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
@jaspar Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he’s above criticism. Try being truthful &amp; the public will believe you again.

"@rrosenbl @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert @Tesla Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn’t fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars."
"@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced."
"@samuelrogg @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today’s Model S is far more refined than initial production."
@rrosenbl @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ABS calibration algorithm
"@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production."
"@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car."
"@camgfrost @DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Stop, you’re making me blush ☺️"
"@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little"
@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Complexity is the devil. Words can’t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But we’ll try.
"@teslaology @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations."
"@LanceUlanoff The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3’s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we’ve seen anything like this."
"@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3’s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers"
"@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this.

"@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit.

@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.

"@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius Yeah, “Reveal” was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today’s non-union."
"@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it."
@AKSINGH_S Yes
@KingLutron @marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius Exactly

"@JimmyRussellExe It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can’t tell"
@AntVenom @zacharyj98 Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
"@Josh_Soto Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now."
@zacharyj98 Good idea ...
@MacTechGenius That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.
@PPathole Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3: 3.5 sec  0-60mph  155 mph Top Speed 310 mile Range"
"@plot_qasc It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
@clemyeung Exactly
Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork.
@Everman @scottwww @KymmPuckeridge @ElementC9 @griff_golf I’m about to test the configurator &amp; then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight
"@AddankiSarat You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards"
@scottwww @KymmPuckeridge @ElementC9 @griff_golf That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!

"@Kasabiii It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released."
What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
"It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage  https://t.co/6gD8MzD6VU"

"@TalkTesla @Techmeme @timkhiggins According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It’s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
"@Techmeme @timkhiggins This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg."

"@joshgans We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom."
"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0."
"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"
"The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors"

"@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV To be clear, I’m a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification"
"@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV The “dry” questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them."

"@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not."
"@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy."

@stephenjudkins @flcnhvy Yes
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
"@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year."
"@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!"
@jchybow @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Pretty much
"@leo_cadle @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Exactly! It’s also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far)."
"@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That’s the sales pitch. Want to go?"
"@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable"
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy As the planets align only once every two years
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
@Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what’s hard.
"@flcnhvy Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half"
"@flcnhvy If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that’s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year"
"@flcnhvy Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it’s designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year"
@flcnhvy The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars

"@FredericLambert @Teslarati The audience of entrepreneurs should try it, not the AF"
@justpaulinelol @Teslarati Naturally
@Teslarati This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called “Pitch Day” &amp; I happened to mention Cybertruck. They don’t buy APCs. It’s the Air Force.
@WillFealey @Teslarati Fair point. Coming soon. We’re making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. 2FA right after that.
"@Teslarati Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software."
@cleantechnica More to come
@bob_burrough Yes
@rafaelcr @OfWudan Would be odd to expect anything else
"@TJ_Cooney That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth"
"@TJ_Cooney Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed."
@flcnhvy Great poem
"Great work by SpaceX Dragon team &amp; Airborne! To be clear, we’ve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row."
"@Teslarati Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called “Low Gear”!"

@Ingvar_Oolsen @neiltyson @Space_Station Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
"@MartianDays @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @AerojetRdyne We def could be wrong about this, but it’s actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don’t need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower."
"@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Also, we’re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that’s leaving a lot on the table"
"@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec."
"@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now."
@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2.  https://t.co/LijrUMuJDq

"@J_ump_er @neiltyson @Space_Station To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth.  https://t.co/21hICWczMq"
"@HarryStoltz1 @neiltyson @Space_Station Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere."
"@neiltyson @Space_Station Most people aren’t aware that orbit (and “zero” gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space."

Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid
"V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout."
"@cutza7 When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you’ll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car."

@Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE There’s so much power going through this engine that it’s close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places
@Carter__99 @Erdayastronaut @askingbubble385 @Cor_SPACE Yes
"@Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE Well, hopefully closer to 300 bar over time. However, that the chamber/nozzle jacket has so many joints &amp; dissimilar metals at such high pressure &amp; temperature is what I find remarkable about it."
"@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE No, we’ve been focusing on production (now on SN12). Only need 250 bar or even a bit less for Starship/Super Heavy. Anything above 250 is nice to have &amp; we’ll get around to it, but not needed for flight."

"@OranMaliphant @Erdayastronaut Could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling &amp; quite robust"
"@Erdayastronaut Better just to ride your max temp all the way down &amp; let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing."
"@DJSnM Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat."
"@Erdayastronaut It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating"

@CptnCrutch5373 @Erdayastronaut @Kalzsom Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
"@Kalzsom @Erdayastronaut For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure."
"@Erdayastronaut Current analysis, which I’m not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2"
"@Erdayastronaut Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward “fin” would simply be used as a leg."
@Erdayastronaut Stability is not an issue with 3

"@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK &amp; Ireland right now, but we don’t raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win."
"@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners That’s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I’m looking into it"
"@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances."
"@Kristennetten @Model3Owners The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world."

"@hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval."
"@Teslatunity @Model3Owners There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all."

"@SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3.

@bitbased @Antsmash @joseph_preece @Erdayastronaut @SpaceXFan97 @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates That’s actually kinda true
@SpaceXFan97 @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower &amp; Starship doesn’t have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
@lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut You’re touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We’re fixing that with Starship.
"@baconmashwbs @Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney’s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you’d exit on another continent."
"@Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin ~1000, as all seats would be “coach” &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It’s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands."
"@YusifzadaAgshin About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips."
"@Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher &amp; stability of booster in ground winds is low"
@C3LT_Games @SciGuySpace There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.
"@ebelliveau @SciGuySpace Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible."

"@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox &amp; fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness &amp; needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms 🤗"
@Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy It’s a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
"@Elthiryel @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor."
"@SpaceXFan97 @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more"
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.
@engadget So cool
@soswow @elontimes Anything with high contrast
@teslaownersSV @elontimes Excessive shades of grey
"@elontimes Yeah, we’ve been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous."
"@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy &amp; immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps."

"@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level"
"@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1."
@DatKlow Chomsky sucks
"Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite  https://t.co/kzjh26eIEn"
Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
"@Erdayastronaut @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy More than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven"
"@HarryStoltz1 @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year."
"@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year."

@cleantechnica Yup
@fcain @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Would love to do exactly that
"@Cosmic_Penguin Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We’ll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits &amp; arrays are tracking to sun."
"@fcain @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we’ll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science."

@meme0boi Fair
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.
@DJSnM Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites &amp; allow some amount of yaw steering.
"@SPEXcast @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars."
"@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Great video.

@AttorneyFrey @MarcusLauer3 @Tesla @Teslarati I think it will be something like that. Much more productive to manage a fleet of robotaxis than only drive one taxi yourself.
"@martinengwicht @JoelSapp @rrosenbl @Tesla 21 TOPS for Xavier. Pegasus is just Xavier with a power hog GPU on a separate board. Problem is you can’t transfer data fast enough between computer &amp; GPU, so GPU usable TOPS is almost irrelevant."

@jeffleach Sad if true 😔
"When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe there’s a good reason that isn’t obvious."
"Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?"
"Over a million combustion engine (it’s right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question."
"Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?"

"@Rebel44CZ Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later."
@brandonbernicky @tsrandall Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
@tsrandall Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won’t spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.

"@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Annoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can’t. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that’s very rare."
"@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last year’s vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer &amp; max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying."
"@Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Probably no fairing either &amp; just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380.

"Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward “HW3” will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important."

"@katlinegrey @lrocket @Alexis_wwww Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active, so only ~50 full-time equivalent people right now. That will grow a lot as we enter production. It’s 10X harder (at least) to design engine production system than engine. In automotive, 100X harder."
"@annerajb @flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed, tight follow distance in test tunnel."
"@annerajb @flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Yes, exciting potential"
@flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Exactly
"@annerajb @lrocket @Alexis_wwww @katlinegrey Printers are too small. Also, high pressure, high efficiency engines need copper cooling channels with an inco/steel jacket. Can’t print yet."
@DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Exactly. This has now happened several times. Something is broken with SEC oversight.
"@lrocket @Alexis_wwww @katlinegrey Tom did an awesome job leading Merlin, Kestrel, Draco &amp; other engine developments from start through 2014 that were critical to SpaceX’s success. Great respect &amp; appreciation!"
"@JaneidyEve Thank you Evelyn, I loved it"
"@alexmd2 @JPUConn @WSJ Indeed. I have great respect for judges. It’s not perfect, but, in general, we should be very glad of the US justice system."

"@SpaceXUpdates @CanzyD Including Heavy, which is 3 cores, around 20 or so"
"@nextspaceflight Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. That’s scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big."
"@CanzyD High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise, at least 20 or 30 missions for Falcon 9. Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life."
@SpaceXUpdates Crew Dragon high altitude abort test

@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos
@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Pinter injector tends to have hot &amp; cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
"@benoitdenayer @navincho @katlinegrey Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars."
"@RichPitre_CO @katlinegrey We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done"
"@Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing ☺️High engine chamber pressure and ablative don’t get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage."
"@sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey That’s true 😀 Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there."
"@Erdayastronaut @MarekCyzio @katlinegrey Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for “launch capability”. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that."
@Geopilot @katlinegrey Don’t know
"@katlinegrey SpaceX commercial 🚀 launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years.  https://t.co/sqAYCCcJtd"
"@martinengwicht @macodiseas @katlinegrey Exactly. That’s the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species."
"@fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I’m worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics."
@wonderofscience So true 🤡 John Clarke 👌
"@macodiseas @katlinegrey Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure &amp; temperature in oxygen preburner"

@McMurchie @SPEXcast @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX The goodwill of the public is critical to Starship’s success
@epoxy101 @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX At least 10X cheaper
"@SPEXcast @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX Very dependent on volume, but I’m confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k &amp; maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth &amp; move to Mars if they want."
@SpaceXFan97 @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX Yes
"@Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX This will sound implausible, but I think there’s a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9"
@13ericralph31 @John_Gardi @SpaceX Close
"@John_Gardi @SpaceX But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter."
@SpaceXFan97 @alexmd2 @SpaceX Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
"@_cgp @SpaceX Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy."
"@John_Gardi @SpaceX Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky."
@13ericralph31 @SpaceX I think 6 where we lit main chamber &amp; several with only preburners

"@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!"
"@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Rocket booster temperatures won’t go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind."

"@Robotbeat @Jon128123 @Diver2441 @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @alan1bernard SpaceX metallurgy team developed SX500 superalloy for 12000 psi, hot oxygen-rich gas. It was hard. Almost any metal turns into a flare in those conditions."
@BENBALLER Thanks!
"@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard It’s embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant"
"@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard You def don’t want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need 100,000 horsepower per engine. That’s not a typo."

"@ludan27 @Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster &amp; orbital payload is gigantic.

"@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel &amp; we’re using a different alloy mix. I super ♥️ 300 Series Stainless!"
"@Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design"

"@Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume."
"@MattRemp Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees."
"@martinengwicht @realkrauswife Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces."
"@ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they’re right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."
"@FredericLambert @boringcompany You’re right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn’t include it. We’re working on one that makes things clear."
"@realkrauswife Pop up, park and walk!"
@realkrauswife I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.
"If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy"

Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars &amp; ground to tunnel car elevators.
Tracking shot of Falcon water landing  https://t.co/6Hv2aZhLjM
"Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon.  https://t.co/O3h8eCgGJ7"
"@DJSnM Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines."
@Dragonmaurizio We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
"@markkrieger Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad."
"Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged &amp; is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched."
Falcon/Dragon launch to @Space_Station in 9 minutes

@bonnienorman @carpenter_maas Good advice
@EESNY @teslaownersSV @S100Dfan Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We’re also working on vision-only driving.
@nikesharora @Tesla Glad you’re ok
"@carpenter_maas Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth."
"@carpenter_maas As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic."

Renaming BFR to Starship
"@universal_sci No, we’re just going to accelerate BFR"
@YoBigBrotha Yes
"Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster"
Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
"@scottymeuk @ScaleyMurrsuit No, it’s got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered."
"@FredericLambert @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast"
"@tsrandall @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output."
"@frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit Lot on our plate, so it’s either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster."
@frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit Ok
@ScaleyMurrsuit Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That’s a great van. We will inquire.
@WillFealey Absolutely agree
@WillFealey Investigating

"@WillFealey Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not."
@acevedo_lex @stars4a_amy @Tesla Should be possible. Please ask service &amp; lmk response.
"@ajaotj36 No, but perhaps in a few years"
"@stars4a_amy Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app."
"@jsteinerman Haha, just like Super Troopers"
@WillFealey Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner
Will allow having your car picked up &amp; dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isn’t needed
Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps
"@FrameshiftShark Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA &amp; USAF are supportive."
@FrameshiftShark Radical change
"Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive."
@annerajb It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
"Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times."

@j_brorsson @smeranda Yes 😀
@Erdayastronaut @smeranda New Summon will use the Autopilot cameras
"@smeranda Yes, aiming for next few months"
"@ajmarquez True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time."
Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
Just reviewed Tesla’s service locations in North America &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.

@JacksMacintosh @SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
@SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert I believe it’s $5k
@SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
@j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Somewhere between 500% &amp; 2000%
"@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU."
"@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude."
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Still a long way to go

@martyeuler @MebFaber Fair point 😀
"@MebFaber When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they’re just “passive” managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!"
"@MebFaber Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative — it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide.  https://t.co/7jk2Bs56HR"

"@annerajb @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman The big funds can &amp; will, as they’re suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for “passive” index tracking."
"@dlauer @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder"
"@KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return."
"@KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators"
@Erdayastronaut I hope to be less wrong over time

"@LanceUlanoff Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car."
"@LanceUlanoff Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good."
@LanceUlanoff Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at  https://t.co/CftQ1v9YCL
"@LanceUlanoff Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric."
@martinengwicht @BlondesE A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
"@LanceUlanoff Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side"
"@LanceUlanoff Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts"

"@momof3terrors Thanks, great feedback. Will be a fun  project for Tesla design. Love the idea of adding a special item every few months, so whenever you go into a Tesla store, there is something new &amp; delightful to see."
"@FredericLambert @woodhaus2 Production design will be better, especially in details. We are dying to do this, but primary focus must remain on making affordable version of Model 3 &amp; bringing Y to market"
@Photofeature He was amazing
@PrydeFoltz Not if you had a wide elastic at the top

"@JohnnaSabri @Medium Love this from P&amp;P: “One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.” Reminds me so of my Nana, who was very stern &amp; strict &amp; yet kindest of all. Believe in good."
@SpaceXUpdates Those are the new design made of titanium. Doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint.
"@lexiheft @FredericLambert @lexfridman Sorry, meant to say same timeframe as hardware"
@komocode @FredericLambert @lexfridman Yes
@FredericLambert @lexfridman Probably 4 to 6 months. Those who order full self-driving get the upgrade at no cost. It isn’t needed just for enhanced Autopilot.

Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that it’s contingent on a shareholder vote.
@MindFieldMusic Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother &amp; less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.
"@thatspacegeek Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every 6 months or so (like SpaceX)"
@FredericLambert No change
Shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares &amp; go private
@heydave7 Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
@Gfilche My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if we’re private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity’s SpaceX investment.
@EvotoRentals Yes
@FredericLambert I don’t have a controlling vote now &amp; wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won’t be selling in either scenario.
Good morning 😀
@LizClaman @Tesla 420
Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.

@LanceUlanoff @vishaljotshi Much more interesting
"@chriscardinal Games &amp; other refinements will go to all Tesla S, X &amp; 3 from start of production. Autopilot enhancements apply to all Model 3’s plus S &amp; X made in last few years (needs Autopilot Hardware V2.0 or higher)."
Glad you’re enjoying Model 3 &amp; thanks for buying a Tesla! Major enhancements to Autopilot &amp; fun games coming in a month with V9.0.

@JaneidyEve For sure
"@danfromtheweb Btw, 1792 is calling &amp; wants its method of execution back. Seriously, what museum do you plan to raid?"
"@annerajb @boringcompany Yeah, great point. Underground power lines would clear up the skyline, be safer to service, have better uptime &amp; save lives of many birds."
No kidding
"@annerajb @danfromtheweb Yes, that will probably be its first use"
"@danfromtheweb Phew 😅. Yeah, we had a drain block 3 months ago &amp; people are working hard to make Tesla successful. Am honored to work with them. Are you trolling for fun or is it part of a job? What motivates you?"

"@annerajb @Flyfiddlesticks @patrickc @stevesi This chart only shows globally competed commercial launches, not US government missions. “Other US” refers to Boeing &amp; Lockheed. Their skill at obtaining govt contracts &amp; subsidies vastly exceeds ours."
"@vincent13031925 @bonnienorman @Jason @scottwww Dunno where this bs is coming from. Who knows about the future, but last week we had over 2000 S/X and 5000 Model 3 *new* net orders."
@DMC_Ryan Definitely. We gave up some grip &amp; width in exchange for range. Would recommend stickier tires &amp; wider on rear for best performance. You might get 3.3 sec 0-60 mph or better with optimized rims &amp; tires.
"@MarkeR2002 @kevinbusch @Paracidic @otgray310 Wow, someone has really thought about this!"

"@adamchavez Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone."
"@adamchavez As this well-written article suggests, my words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths &amp; suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness &amp; according to specifications from the dive team leader."
@lrroberts87 Good point
@nealboudette @BertelSchmitt @AmazingChevVolt I have never donated to a SuperPAC
"@danielbrennan Yes, about 0.5% of what I donated to @SierraClub, which is a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue"

"@jack_p That said, I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes."
@stfuszn @jack_p So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity
"@jack_p Thanks Jack. To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent &amp; politically moderate. Doesn’t mean I’m moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me &amp; I don’t understand why they are not important to everyone."

"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."
@ArkadiuszKula @JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Good idea
"@JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack."
@LittleMissFlint You’re welcome. Happy birthday! 🎁🎉🎂
"@MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about in that tweet — double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying."
@williamwinters @austinhopperrrr @maysacha @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.
@jeremysliew It’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
"@siwgrindaker @erikveen Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
@erikveen I would def recommend this
@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?

"@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Great, thanks"
@JamesWorldSpace Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
"@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water won’t come in"
"@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
@JamesWorldSpace SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
"@JamesWorldSpace Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit."
"@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power."
@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
"@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you’re in an air tube, time doesn’t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
@JamesWorldSpace Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
@cate_long @lopezlinette Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for &amp; parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.
"@MelissaLeeCNBC @thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews I know you &amp; believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said"

@lopezlinette They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I don’t use Facebook.

Why won’t Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
@tombrechet @vassilyk @FlatJannrickles @vincent13031925 @TeslaBull @scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette @Tesla Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
@steveshmidt @thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews True
"@vincent13031925 @TeslaBull @scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette So @lopezlinette publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Tesla’s most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is “one of the greatest.” Her articles print Chanos’s view verbatim. This is not journalism."
"@scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette .@lopezlinette You stated publicly that you “see eye to eye” with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?"
@TeslaBull What a coincidence …
@thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews Am not attacking all media or even all of @CNBC. Just asked if you inform public about an analyst’s prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
"@stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: @lopezlinette, did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?"
"@benjaminpollock @CNBC Exactly. @cnbc, I just asked a simple question. Please answer."
"@ICannot_Enough @SimRiyat @gawwy @aperezposada @Reuters @sal19 Strange. @cnbc, is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst’s track record before hearing their opinion."
"Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself.  https://t.co/xSG2Mmy756"
"@S_Padival @lopezlinette Sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette, is it possible you’re  serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla’s biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?"
"@S_Padival @lopezlinette has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &amp;3 production number, which is physically impossible."
"@gawwy @aperezposada @Reuters @sal19 Wow, so @sal19 of @Reuters wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work @sal19 &amp; @Reuters."
"@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number?"
"@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target."

@JohnnaSabri @indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter &amp; simpler than most.
"@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow ...which clearly doesn’t work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what’s happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they’re getting desperate."
"@doctorow @dimas_______ @Robotbeat Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread."
@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
@TeslaCharts How big is your short position? Just curious.
@BobbieBees @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. This one guy’s claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
"@doctorow I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right."
"@dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow UAW doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they’re getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps."
"@TheSithSeth @doctorow I’m not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can’t compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don’t want Tesla to die too."
"@Robotbeat @doctorow I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people."
"@AntVenom @Shaynooooo @kausthav_ray @SpaceX Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult."
"@doctorow Iain certainly wasn’t pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldn’t be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through &amp; through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but that’s a special case."

"@MKBHD You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don’t think there will be another."
"@LanceUlanoff Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time."
"@LanceUlanoff Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the “halo crown” effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric."
"@anandrajk @lexiheft @Tesla That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9.

"@samuelrogg @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability.

"@Josh_Soto Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now."
@zacharyj98 Good idea ...
@MacTechGenius That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.
@PPathole Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3: 3.5 sec  0-60mph  155 mph Top Speed 310 mile Range"
"@plot_qasc It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
@clemyeung Exactly

"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"

@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Found the source of the problem. The NASA database has the Falcon Block 1 performance. Version currently in production and set to fly in a few months is Block 5. SpaceX GNC team is submitting updated numbers.
@kerrbones @nextspaceflight Not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine relights. Fix is pretty obvious.

@nextspaceflight A third is under construction
"@DJSnM @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Under consideration. We’ve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing 2, flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be &amp; will if BFR takes longer than expected."
"@DavideDF_ @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Side boosters landing on droneships &amp; center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M."

@AngryPackOMeese @dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Of course :)
"@AngryPackOMeese @dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Maybe that plan works out, but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before 2023"
"@dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high."
"@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not."
"@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy."

Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin &amp; turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.

Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
"@elonmusk F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg"
"@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers."
@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
@elonmusk Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.

"If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site

Engines are cycling cleanly w ground pneumatics. Replaced gas generator on engine 9 (center) as a precautionary measure.
"Abort was caused by oxygen in ground side TEA-TEB. Upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk."
"Rocket engines are healthy, but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day. Aiming for Mon eve launch."
@WilliamShatner Will do. Probably at least a few days. Depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps.
We called manual abort. Better to be paranoid and wrong. Bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
"If launch aborts, we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection, so probably a few days before next attempt"
"Increasing helium spin start pressure. Probably &lt;50% chance of passing all aborts, but worth a try. Countdown resuming ..."
Launch aborted by autosequence due to slower than expected thrust ramp. Seems ok on closer inspection. Cycling countdown.

@teslaownerssv @JohnEG78 @TeslaChillMode @UNPLGD3 @MFrunker @ccteslaclub Hopefully next month
"@JohnEG78 @TeslaChillMode @UNPLGD3 @MFrunker @ccteslaclub Ok. Overall air suspension height &amp; damping algorithm is getting a lot of attention. Will be linked to FSD, so acts automatically."
@karpathy Haha true
@HumanoidHistory The Promise is greatly needed
"@EvaFoxU We will have special colors for new Roadster, as we did for the original"
@RationalEtienne @TheBabylonBee 🤣🤣
.@TheBabylonBee is savage 🤣🤣
@WorldAndScience If you ever wondered where we came from
"This is a life leader launch, so more risk than normal"
"@TesLatino @flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz Yes, but only slightly filled"
@aholstein404 @flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz This is a subject of much debate
@flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz Major upgrades are slated for SN15
"@flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz Many small improvements, but overall similar. Wiring is more robust, engines are more mature, nosecone is sealed better, etc."
@thesheetztweetz But that’s why we have SN 9 &amp; SN10
"@thesheetztweetz Lot of things need to go right, so maybe 1/3 chance"
"Good Starship SN8 static fire! Aiming for first 15km / ~50k ft altitude flight next week. Goals are to test 3 engine ascent, body flaps, transition from main to header tanks &amp; landing flip."
@Erdayastronaut @MarcusHouseGame Maybe start on that a year from now. Depends on how Starship progress goes.
@RationalEtienne @MarcusHouseGame Not yet
"@StarshipFairing @MarcusHouseGame Not bad! We will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all propellant, but it’s probably smarter than a whole new shorter external hull."
"@MarcusHouseGame Rapid &amp; complete rocket reuse, low cost propellant, orbital refilling &amp; propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life multiplanetary"
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @Teslarati @TeslaRoadTrip Yes
"@PPathole @Teslarati @TeslaRoadTrip We’re still far from simply video in, control out. The biggest game-changer, currently underway at Tesla, is 360 degree, high fps video for labeling, training &amp; inference."
@Teslarati @TeslaRoadTrip FSD Beta 5 coming out in a few days. Improvement should be significant.
@XHNews Exciting mission!
@vincent13031925 @Tesla Wow
@Liv_Boeree Yea
"Tomorrow will be the 7th flight of this rocket, landing on droneship Of Course I Still Love You"
@JohnnaCrider1 @teslaownerssv @28delayslater Sure
@FutureJurvetson @flcnhvy True
@RationalEtienne @heydave7 @philwhln We have quiet a queue of products to build! Better do new Roadster at some point😬.
"@RationalEtienne @ShyCybertruck Fate loves irony, but hates hypocrisy"
@ICannot_Enough @heydave7 Yes 😃
@flcnhvy Our data center was named Skynet as a joke over 10 years ago. Might have been tempting fate!
@heydave7 @philwhln Tesla is a vehicle for creating &amp; producing many useful products
@NASASpaceflight Largest cast titanium part in the world. No heat shielding needed.
Landing at Vandenberg AFB in California
"@tobyliiiiiiiiii @SpaceX @NASA @NASA_LSP @NASAJPL @esa Actually, off to the side (so it doesn’t take out the launch mount in bad landing), but with the same arm used to pick up the ship"
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @SpaceX @NASA @NASA_LSP @NASAJPL @esa Where it should be!
"@philwhln @heydave7 Because I am not an investor. Tesla is definitely not the only good company, but investing is not what I do. But I always put my own money into companies I help create, otherwise it’d be wrong to ask others to do so."
"Well, almost anything"
Quite the day ahead
@NASAaero @LockheedMartin Now *this* is what you’d call pointy!
@cleantechnica Cool
"@Astro_Fonseca @Space_Station @wonderofscience @VirtualAstro They’re moving at ~25 times the speed of sound, but it feels like nothing"
@WorldAndScience  https://t.co/XAJaN4j9ZR
@vicentes @EvaFoxU @PPathole @mirojurcevic @TashaARK @Space_Station There will always be upgrades
@EvaFoxU @PPathole @mirojurcevic @TashaARK @Space_Station It will be better than human vision by quite a margin
@enn_nafnlaus @mirojurcevic @TashaARK @Space_Station Reality looks like a strange ghost-world at radar wavelengths. Almost everything except metal is translucent.
@PPathole @mirojurcevic @TashaARK @Space_Station Exactly
"@mirojurcevic @TashaARK This is a misperception. SpaceX developed &amp; continues to use lidar for Dragon docking with @Space_Station.   Just pointless imo for self-driving. If you’re going to do active photon generation, use an occlusion penetrating wavelength, like precision radar at ~4mm."
@PhilippeCROIZON @SpaceX One day we will fly you on Starship
@Peter_J_Beck Well done!
"@hisdirtremoves @SpaceX I can’t comment on turbopump internal details, but you’re roughly in the ballpark. Wow, rocket turbopumps, especially if oxygen-rich, are insanely hard! Arguably, the hardest mechanical/fluids/combustion problem known to exist."
"@TashaARK To be clear, this was just an XPeng problem. Other companies in China have not done this."
"@IsaacLatterell @TashaARK @karpathy Andrej is awesome, but it should be said that we have a very talented Autopilot/AI team at Tesla. Too much credit comes to me &amp; Andrej."
@spacetouristuk @TashaARK Yeah. They stole Apple’s code too.  https://t.co/gy4DT7Pq9N
@TashaARK They have an old version of our software &amp; don’t have our NN inference computer

@Astronomiaum Let the Martians decide their own future
@shifthappends @Tesla A lot of my brain space is spent dealing with both units!
"@Astronomiaum Terraforming will be too slow to be relevant in our lifetime. However, we can establish a human base there in our lifetime. At least a future spacefaring civilization – discovering our ruins – will be impressed humans got that far."
@PPathole @xDreamCoding @garyblack00 That is certainly the intention!
@xDreamCoding @garyblack00  https://t.co/fREZwjCwNa
@garyblack00 The only publicly traded stock I own is Tesla
"@garyblack00 Wise words from Bogle. The point of companies is products &amp; services. They have no point in &amp; of themselves, nor do these indices. Buy &amp; hold stock in companies where you love the product roadmap, sell where you don’t.  https://t.co/yHVQJXTahn"
"@teslaownerssv @AstroJordy @flcnhvy No, just a mild cold. Same with my bro. Def had cov2 though. Pc&lt;20 means viral load of &gt;10 million per mL."
"@Astronomiaum Life in glass domes at first. Eventually, terraformed to support life, like Earth."
@AstroJordy @flcnhvy Yeah
"@Daywalker_xD @Astronomiaum I was going to say “Sim!”, but that seemed too obvious haha"
@Astronomiaum Deveras!
"@flcnhvy And cases with high (non-infectious) Ct should quarantine for a few days, while getting another test. Second test determines whether they’re just beginning to get ill or are on the long tail afterwards, where viral fragments exist, but person is not infectious."

"@peterrhague It’s designed to make life multiplanetary, otherwise extreme overkill for mere Earth sector activity!   Starship fleet mass to orbit per year will be more than 1000 times all current Earth rockets combined, including Falcon. Necessary, for a city on Mars."
@Kristennetten @royalsociety More like he gave it his blessing. It was sort of a groundswell of those who believed in the scientific method in London.
Nullius in Verba @royalsociety
@westcoastbill Indeed
@ReflexFunds @nickidk4 @pcgamer Dojo/Doge
"@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah, looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than $1M for more than 100 tons to orbit, so it’s mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year"
@speculawyer @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Exactly
"@Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Merlin is a strong local maximum design, but kerosene is suboptimal fuel, no matter what you do.   What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene, so ~78% of propellant is oxygen."
"@parstalberg @josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yes, but from a visiting American. Ah, the irony is just too much!!"
"@josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah, PCR Ct was unequivocal at &lt;20. Doesn’t matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold."
@flcnhvy @LUGG4S1 @pcgamer Maybe making some notable changes. Will wait until figurative &amp; literal dust settles.
"@ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Pretty close. Definitely feel 💯 if I take DayQuil. Frankly, this was one of the mildest cold/flu experiences I’ve ever had."
@LUGG4S1 @pcgamer Avionics cables moving to steel pipe shields &amp; adding water-cooled steel pipes to test pad
"@LUGG4S1 @pcgamer About 2 secs after starting engines, martyte covering concrete below shattered, sending blades of hardened rock into engine bay. One rock blade severed avionics cable, causing bad shutdown of Raptor."
@Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 The most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they *sometimes* don’t blow up! The amount of power going through them boggles the mind.
@pcgamer We should just count the atoms at this point
"@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @CharlesNOtrumps @rweb11742 Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. This is true in general. For cars, production is over 99% of the problem. That 1% inspiration is very important, but it’s less than 1% of the pain."
@Erdayastronaut @CharlesNOtrumps @rweb11742 Our first Merlin engine design was really bad tbh. Nothing worked well &amp; some parts didn’t work at all. 18 years later &amp; thousands of upgrades make it a great GG cycle engine.

@gaertner_anne @Neuro_Skeptic @DresdenTea @judith_herbers Haha
@michaelmina_lab Great thread
"@SamTalksTesla I’m ok, thanks for asking. No symptoms for past few days, apart from fatigue. Unless something changes, would have to say that it simply felt like a mild cold."
♥️

"Dragon can also hover &amp; land propulsively, but we use the parachutes for maximum safety  https://t.co/Mr7VFIQwWf"
"Thrusters are integrated with spacecraft, enabling abort capability all the way to abort for increased safety"
@tboneagnoobs Ok
"@KlotzAdam @PPathole @AstroJordy @erujabidi Yeah, I feel pretty normal. No symptoms right now. Last week, I had symptoms of a minor cold. I’ve had some brutal flu/cold experiences, but this was mild &amp; hopefully over."
"@PPathole @AstroJordy @erujabidi Doing tests from several different labs, same time of day, administered by RN &amp; am requesting N1 gene PCR cycle threshold. There is no official standard for PCR testing. Not sure people realize this."
"@PPathole @Mario_Livio Both obv insanely great, too bad they had this pointless argument"
Astronaut launch today!
@Mario_Livio No kids though
@Mario_Livio Hell of a wig collection too
@michaelmina_lab It would be great if labs could give people this level of granular feedback in their results
Worth reading this thread if you’re curious about rona testing
"@stonkmanup @michaelmina_lab They should be imo. If you get a blood pressure test, they tell you the number, not just if it’s high/not-high. There is not a clear consensus on what Ct value of what cov2 gene constitutes “positive”."
"@AstroJordy @erujabidi A little up &amp; down. Feels just like a regular cold, but more body achy &amp; cloudy head than coughing/sneezing. DayQuil rocks."
"@michaelmina_lab In your opinion, at what Ct number for the cov2 N1 gene should a PCR test probably be regarded as positive? If I’m asking the wrong question, what is a better question?"
@michaelmina_lab @stendeck77 !
"@teslaownerssv Cool, but please be super cautious. Expect two steps forward, one back. Lot of new code was merged."
@austinbarnard45 Just a scratch. We can buff it out.
"@erujabidi Am getting wildly different results from different labs, but most likely I have a moderate case of covid. My symptoms are that of a minor cold, which is no surprise, since a coronavirus is a type of cold."

"@WhatsupFranks The number of PCR amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load. From what I can gather, you’re probably not infectious above 30 &amp; you probably are below 25. Sound about right?"
@MrSammy_H @max_roi @rossy65 This a great reference! Worth a read.
Case closed  https://t.co/pUYiJcAdD6
Soon  https://t.co/mWOpR7W8kk
"@PPathole Fwiw, lab I just spoke to thinks below 30 is accurate, 30 to 40 gets dicey &amp; above 40 is bs. Will talk to several more labs. There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere."
Lab I just spoke to said cov2 PCR detection (N1 &amp; N3 genes) below 30 cycles is reliable &amp; above 40 cycles is not
"@RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Note, this is not the spike protein. They don’t consider that reliable."
"@RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles &amp; 40 cycles is their max."
@PPathole Strange
"@ryaneshea Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold &amp; flu prevalence vs prior years. If someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms &amp; falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu."
"@ryaneshea Moreover, lower the true prevalence, the higher the false positive number will be. This sounds obvious, but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low."
@ryaneshea From  https://t.co/42z7vRPB9c  https://t.co/XTSukcc3Tl
@dana_e_morgan Sure is
"Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry. What’s the approximate false positive rate, all things considered, for cov2 PCR tests?"
@ClareCraigPath Interesting
@john_beans @DirtyTesla Interesting
What is the general population (no knowledge of symptoms) accuracy of a sars-cov2 PCR test &amp; is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles?
"@PPathole @cleantechnica A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov2 spike proteins, although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too. Hard to get a straight answer.   False positives will roughly scale with # of tests &amp; daily test rate has gone ballistic:  https://t.co/Pv6s71jZQo"
"@justpaulinelol @cleantechnica Mild sniffles &amp; cough &amp; slight fever past few days. Right now, no symptoms, although I did take NyQuil."
"@cleantechnica Technically, I tested positive, then negative twice, then positive again, so “Elon Musk Tests Negative for Covid” is an equally correct title. The “rapid antigen test” from BD seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin."
The carousel turns ever faster
@JoeInGeneral @andrewbogut Yup
@ajtourville Exactly
@JaneidyEve Symptoms of a typical cold. Nothing unusual so far.
"@BLKMDL3 If it’s happening to me, it’s happening to others. I’m getting PCR tests from separate labs. Results will take about 24 hours."
"Something extremely bogus is going on. Was tested for covid four times today. Two tests came back negative, two came back positive. Same machine, same test, same nurse. Rapid antigen test from BD."
"@austinbarnard45 Burst disk worked, so vehicle appears to be ok. We’ll have to swap out at least one of the engines."
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @SpacePadreIsle @austinbarnard45 Maybe melted an engine preburner or fuel hot gas manifold. Whatever it is caused pneumatics loss. We need to design out this problem.
"@austinbarnard45 We lost vehicle pneumatics. Reason unknown at present. Liquid oxygen header tank pressure is rising. Hopefully triggers burst disk to relieve pressure, otherwise it’s going to pop the cork."

"@jgrano305 @flcnhvy To the best of my knowledge, literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades.   Most of the factory had no equipment at all! Even light bulbs were missing in some areas.  GM &amp; Toyota took everything that worked &amp; moved it to their other factories."
"@flcnhvy All that was left were broken bots &amp; equipment hardly worth the scrap metal value. But we scrounged up spare parts, fixed the trusty old bots &amp; brought the factory back to life."
@flcnhvy And there were actually zero employees in the factory after GM/Toyota left. They took all good equipment &amp; sold most of rest for scrap. It looked apocalyptic inside.

"@EliBurton_ @teslaownersSV Sure, it could be an option in settings"
@teslaownersSV Visualization will tone down significantly for production. These are intentionally strident colors.
@Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ Sure
"@Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ I’m in Boca every week, so maybe we could talk then. Given that Starship is not exactly subtle, this is more of a design clarification to match what people can already see."
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ Good point. Probably next week in form of a written piece on SpaceX website.
@austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ Great pics! That we now have the beginnings of a Starship production system is most meaningful.
"@WholeMarsBlog Yup. With beta updates, there’ll be a lot of 2 steps fwd, 1 step back situations, but pace of improvement will be extremely fast."
@bart_sanders Working on it. Also needs to be able fart at other cars on command.
@SpacePadreIsle Starship is coming together!
Price change is pushed to Thursday next week. Applies only to US for now. One week clock will start in other countries as beta is released. FSD monthly rental will also be available sometime next year.
@austinbarnard45 There will be a 360 deg glass Star Bar (name tbd) at top of high bay
"@DMC_Ryan Well, we have said many times that the price will rise as the product functionality improves. How much time do you think we should give?"
@StephenKing Agreed. Are these performance tires?
"@SpaceX Just a small-seeming issue with loss of upper stage camera. Probably nothing serious, but standing down to re-examine whole vehicle just in case."
@flcnhvy Sure
"Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release, FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on Monday"
"@TeslaGong @PPathole @teslaownersSV @tesla_raj As soon as we complete testing &amp; regulators approve. So many different traffic signs, rules &amp; languages around world, not to mention driving on left side of road!

@PPathole @teslaownersSV @tesla_raj Yes
@teslaownersSV @tesla_raj Haha
@Teslarati Dependent on proving high safety
"@WholeMarsBlog Not intentional! We just wanted to show that you could theoretically convert the entire US vehicle fleet to electric using only the lithium in Nevada, a single state. Tesla will do lithium mining only as needed. We also found a way to extract lithium using NaCl (table salt)."

@Erdayastronaut After it gets to orbit a few times
@Erdayastronaut Got a little melty tbh :)
"@Erdayastronaut Those engines could go 300 bar, but would be dicey. Pushing it for near-term tests doesn’t achieve anything, but I’m confident Raptor will do 300 bar for orbital flights."
@Erdayastronaut Raptor has now run for 90 secs at 300 bar chamber pressure before encountering issues. 210 mT-F sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes.   R-Boost variant is aiming for 300 ton thrust at 300 bar with same nozzle exit area. Will need bigger pumps.
"FSD beta rollout happening tonight. Will be extremely slow &amp; cautious, as it should."
Data from 3 engine Starship static fire this morning looks good. Proceeding with nosecone mate.
@PPathole @toadmeister Yes. We also have to consider population life-months lost from lockdowns &amp; other restrictions vs life-months lost from any given disease.

"@flcnhvy Good grief! SpaceX is getting zero money for this. Starship is designed to carry people &amp; cargo around Earth (also to moon &amp; Mars). Vast majority of use will be civilian. It’s just like an airline in space. All airlines sometimes carry military cargo, but ~99% is civilian."
"@Teslarati With FSD, we got stuck in a lot of local maximums, which wasn’t clear until we hit the ceiling. This time, it’s right."
"@RationalEtienne @28delayslater Thank you, much more accurate haha"
@28delayslater This graph appears to be upside down
"@Teslarati Sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate. Almost every element of production is &gt;75% automated. Only wire harnesses &amp; general assembly, which are &lt;10% of production costs, are primarily manual."
@TeslaClubIN @cleantechnica Will release order configurator probably in Jan
"@cleantechnica Limited FSD beta releasing on Tuesday next week, as promised. This will, at first, be limited to a small number of people who are expert &amp; careful drivers."
"@shortword @jwangARK The SoC’s sync with each other 20 to 30 times/sec, exchanging output of NNs that should be in harmony, like a symphony, so it’s fairly obvious when one is discordant"
"@jwangARK Tesla FSD computer’s dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes — they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails."
"@jwangARK Accurate analysis. Quite a few  ego/intelligence&gt;&gt;1 people in your comment thread haha. Neither MobilEye nor Nvidia, which are certainly good companies, could meet any of our capability, schedule, cost or power requirements."

@MariaBartiromo @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @JeffBezos @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness I have seen no evidence of an advanced civilization visiting Earth. Fuzzy pics that are worse than a 7/11 security cam frame grab don’t count!
"@electricfuture5 We face a tough dichotomy of applying resources to the old architecture or applying them to the new. It’s not a question of money. If there was a “great engineer” factory, we would place a large order! Unfortunately, great engineers are very rare. This is solved in the FSD build."
@flcnhvy Definitely
"@enn_nafnlaus Exactly. He plays the “poor inventor” card, but was rich all along &amp; invented nothing (as far as I know). I went down to zero cash or sellable assets in 2008/2009, had no house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent."
"@enn_nafnlaus There are sketchy edits to Tesla wiki that whitewash Eberhard’s problems/glorify his role. Pretty odd. I was interim CEO/co-CEO from July 2007. Michael Marks was co-CEO for ~Q4 2007 &amp; Ze’ev Drori for Q1 to ~Q3 2008. After Q3 2008 financing round bust, no choice but to be CEO."
"@enn_nafnlaus When Eberhard was fired from the Tesla CEO role in mid 2007 for providing false information to me &amp; the board, no one left with him. That says it all."

"@TashaARK Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation.   It’s already sensible for rocket engine parts. To the best of our knowledge, SpaceX is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive."
"@RenataKonkoly @franktinsley @ankitXupta @TashaARK Pretty much, but I think it may end on a high note"
@EVHQ2 @TashaARK Meant to say that it should be fixed in the latest wide release. Won’t need to wait for FSD.
@EVHQ2 @TashaARK It should be
@franktinsley @ankitXupta @TashaARK Exactly. We barked up that tree for way too long (sigh). Gives a false sense of victory being close — a tantalizing local maximum — but reality is just too messy &amp; weird. Our new system is capable of driving in locations we never seen even once.

@tesladri @ChananBos @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog The crash absorption rails can be cut off &amp; replaced with a bolted part for collision repair
@ICannot_Enough @WholeMarsBlog Sandy Munro understands engineering
"@flcnhvy @teslaownersSV @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog That would be like licensing Battlestar Galactica. Actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard part. Lots of people who worked at Tesla Gigafactories now work at competitors, but none of those companies have made one."
"@teslaownersSV @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Yes, the Gigafactory is the hardest &amp; most critical product"
"@ChananBos @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper &amp; lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity &amp; improved polar moment or inertia. This is a *major* breakthrough."
@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog But now we understand production much better. It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term.
@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy.
"@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three."
"@EvaFoxU @WholeMarsBlog Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but it’s fun &amp; takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10,000 people &amp; hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly."
@skorusARK Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate.
"@WholeMarsBlog Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can’t emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part."
@WholeMarsBlog We do expect to make heavy use of LFP for medium range cars &amp; stationary storage
"@WholeMarsBlog Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack &amp; front &amp; rear single piece castings. Also, a new paint system.   Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin, which means significant production risk. Fremont &amp; Shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven."

"@klod_ua @Erdayastronaut @TrevorMahlmann @johnkrausphotos @Mike_Seeley Cryo pressure test succeeded, but a small leak opened up near the engine mounts, possibly due to differential shrinking"

"@SpaceX Once these satellites reach their target position, we will be able to roll out a fairly wide public beta in northern US &amp; hopefully southern Canada. Other countries to follow as soon as we receive regulatory approval."
@flcnhvy @alvianchoiri We’re not seeing notable differences yet. I think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights. Some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced. Maybe turbopump hot sections.
@PPathole @alvianchoiri Roughly a week or two turnaround is all that’s needed to meet max launch demand. Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour.
"@alvianchoiri Ahem, yes, it was the 3rd flight of this booster &amp; 3rd flight for active half of fairing. Aiming for 10+ flights of booster &amp; fairing by end of next year."
4th flight &amp; landing for this booster
5 minutes from launch. Looks good so far.
"@cleantechnica So crazy to subsidize pollution! This is not good for people, especially in dense cities with heavy traffic, where your air intake is jammed up against another car’s exhaust pipe."
"@SciGuySpace It’s a step in the right direction, but they should really aim for full reusability by 2026. Larger rocket would also make sense for literal economies of scale. Goal should be to minimize cost per useful ton to orbit or it will at best serve a niche market."

@WholeMarsBlog @ajtourville @comma_ai @Tesmanian_com Yes
@DanielleFong @ajtourville @comma_ai @Tesmanian_com Absolutely needs liquid cooling. We’re applying our experience cooling half megawatt drive unit power electronics in cars to computers.
"@TeslaTested That’s an error in Canada. The lease payment is specifically lower than loan financing, as Tesla expects to repossess the car. This is essentially a bet on residual value. If you believe residual value will rise, buy on loan, if you think it will drop, then lease."

"@Erdayastronaut @nextspaceflight I don’t want be cavalier, but there isn’t an obvious limit. 100+ flights are possible. Some parts will need to be replaced or upgraded. Cleaning all 9 Merlin turbines is difficult. Raptor is way easier in this regard, despite being a far more complex engine."

"@Erdayastronaut @C_Bass3d @NASASpaceflight @FelixSchlang It’s counter-intuitive, but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant &amp; pump-fed (light tanks), that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said, hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers &amp; stabilizing ship if landing in high winds!"
"@nextspaceflight Payload reduction due to reusability of booster &amp; fairing is &lt;40% for F9 &amp; recovery &amp; refurb is &lt;10%, so you’re roughly even with 2 flights, definitely ahead with 3"

"@SciGuySpace Tank didn’t burst, but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result &amp; supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. We’re developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable."
"@Peter_J_Beck @torybruno @Starlinksat223 @Erdayastronaut Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust.

"@John_Gardi @SciGuySpace Also, insulation of a deep cryogen( which I’d call anything that liquifies nitrogen aka 78% of air) is heavy &amp; prone to heat leaks. H2 is hell."

"@Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice.

"In his 18th Brumaire essay (in which he does make some good points), Marx famously said history repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. This is now ironically happening with Marxism."
@CodingMark @ResistMonsters @TheZenCorner @stoolpresidente Exactly
@flcnhvy Tesla makes the safest cars in the world &amp; our factory injury rate is better than industry avg &amp; tracking to be better than any auto plant in North America. We care deeply about safety at a fundamental level.
"@flcnhvy SpaceX has 8000 employees in California, Washington, Texas &amp; Florida. Operating this entire time, as we have national security exemption. Zero deaths or serious illnesses."
@flcnhvy Absolutely. Tesla already went through this in China with 7000 employees. Zero fatalities or serious illnesses.

@bradd_libby Tesla is the biggest manufacturer in California &amp; second biggest exporter

"@EverydayElon @SjvTesla @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Absolutely, please do! You should be allowed to recoup damages from the county."
"@SjvTesla @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla San Joaquin County, right next door to Alameda, has been sensible &amp; reasonable, whereas Alameda has been irrational &amp; detached from reality.

"@GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA."

"@kulpability @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight No, but it’s mostly the same as the ship, except for the thrust bulkhead (31 engines vs 6)"
"@sspencer_smb @flcnhvy It’s not all about engineering, although that is my personal favorite. Striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal."
"@flcnhvy To be clear, I do think finance &amp; law are important, but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also, too many MBAs."
"@raytech247 @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case)"
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of Mars
"@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 &amp; 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg."
@Kristennetten @lexfridman @joerogan 🤣🤣

@GavinNewsom Yeah!!
"@Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight A fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth. Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc."

"@WhatsupFranks Yes, same results are showing up pretty much everywhere on Earth. Contagion is higher in high pop density cities &amp; mortality proportionate to age."
Silver lining is that mortality rate is much lower than predicted &amp; herd immunity much higher. Good news.
@ajtourville @psidart @TOGregTO Maybe Cybertruck will have it …
"@psidart @TOGregTO I’m dying to do super efficient, quiet home HVAC with HEPA &amp; water distillation. It’s weird, but I really want to do it."
@westcoastbill Good one
@jgrano305 @teslaownersSV @TOGregTO Will talk with team. We have a lot on our plate!
"@teslaownersSV @TOGregTO Side camera view looks a little weird, as meant for self-driving, but will review with team. Image will need a little post-processing."
"@TOGregTO That is more reasonable, especially if mostly loans. Oil &amp; gas is an important industry without which civilization could not function at this time, but financial support should be proportionate to rest of economy."
@TheOnion So shall we all
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut Yes
@Erdayastronaut Haha sure
@Teslarati Good summary

"@TOGregTO Frankly, much of the stimulus money is questionable, but this much to oil &amp; gas seems especially so"
@TOGregTO Not the greatest use of money
"@anime_virus @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @MFrunker If this launch succeeds, we will have put up 422 satellites …"
@thirdrowtesla @MFrunker Thanks! We are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness btw. Should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle &amp; all sats get sunshades starting with launch 9.
@thirdrowtesla @MFrunker Makes sense
@nichegamer Nice
@jgrano305 @PPathole @Supernova_Style Anything surprising?
@PPathole @Supernova_Style Numbers I was told from Wuhan were 80% to 90% mortality rate for invasive ventilators. Those are not good odds.
"@Supernova_Style When I talked to doctors in Wuhan, they recommended against invasive ventilators &amp; in favor of non-invasive"
@Supernova_Style No kidding …

"@teslaownersSV @Erdayastronaut Fully reusable orbital rocket, then orbital refilling, then Mars"
@Peter_J_Beck @thesheetztweetz @ulalaunch @torybruno @SpaceX 10% would be impressive. Anything below a 20% payload hit would be outstanding.
"@Erdayastronaut I sure hope so! This will inspire the world &amp; get people excited about the future, just as Apollo did. It wasn’t just that a few people went to the moon, they went there for all humankind."
"@WhatsupFranks @flcnhvy Another reason reported mortality rate is overstated is that dying *with* covid is not same as dying *from* covid. Media keeps reporting former, not latter."
@InSpaceXItrust @jgrano305 Maybe 1.5% change to interior dimensions. Still very roomy.
@jgrano305 Probably 3 to 6 months
"@flcnhvy Moreover, there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid. If they put Boris Johnson on mask ventilator, but *not* invasive, that tells you something! This article incorrectly conflates invasive as “ventilator”, but makes many good points  https://t.co/5cPQ29wOvu"
@flcnhvy You’d think they’d at least be Wikipedia-level informed about ventilators! It clearly articulates the difference between invasive &amp; non-invasive. It’s very misleading to the public to claim that only the invasive type are “real ventilators”.  https://t.co/wHkAQ9177V

“Dr. Levitan advocates combining breathing support from a CPAP machine or regular oxygen with comfortable positioning”. Yup.
“Don’t jump to intubation.” — Dr Caputo
"@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @dschless @Bob_Wachter A mask or nose “ventilator” with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation &amp; you’re fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable."
@flcnhvy @dschless @Bob_Wachter Sounds about right  https://t.co/pEPVJi56Vg
@dschless @Bob_Wachter Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I’m hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic?
"@TJShannon87 @Bob_Wachter I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked, one in NYC and one in Arlington"
@annerajb @samoanpunch @cromas @Bob_Wachter We’re working super hard on getting traffic lights &amp; stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year.
"@Bob_Wachter They were, but are they currently?"
@samoanpunch @cromas @Bob_Wachter Interesting
"@Bob_Wachter We are hearing almost all hospital ICUs have excess capacity. In some cases, 60% empty."
@RationalEtienne @PPathole @fat__tire @Kristennetten @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.
@Erdayastronaut @BnOrdhaug @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck Sure
"@Erdayastronaut @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck Production is by *far* the hard part.

"@sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially @rocketlab.

"@fat__tire @Kristennetten @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Vast majority of “ventilators” are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient’s throat &amp; driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved!

"@thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing."
"@SciGuySpace @Some1gee Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That’s the acid test."

@28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Weird that so many troll/bot accounts were activated to attack on this fake issue. Wonder who’s behind it.
"@flcnhvy @28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Yeah, very important to provide C/BiPAP devices to *prevent* cases from becoming severe. Once severe (intratracheal intubation), survival rates are low."
"@28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Invasive ventilators are for worst case patients. Survival rate at that point is low, as Gov Cuomo has pointed out. Nonetheless, we start delivery of intratracheal Medtronic units in NYC tonight."
"@28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Exactly. Moreover, all hospitals were given exact specifications of Resmed &amp; Philips ventilators before delivery &amp; all confirmed they would be critical."

@PPathole @NateSilver538 Up to 80% false positive
"@PPathole @NateSilver538 Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases &amp; using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand."

The degree to which SolarGlass will positively effect the esthetics &amp; energy sustainability of neighborhoods throughout the world is not yet well appreciated. This is a very important product.
"Tesla April company talk will be from our Giga New York factory, where we make SolarGlass &amp; several other products. Will also offer customer &amp; media tours."
Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It’s stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don’t do it justice.
"@brittanygayle98 Its integrated roof &amp; solar, so should be light enough for almost any home"
@dafuq_mac Coming hopefully later this year
"@TarunBhatt161 I think will still be better than a normal roof, but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice &amp; snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows!"
"@Emmonstein No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, it’s very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles."
@_mantis_ Sounds should note that it gets less shiny automatically due to dust &amp; weathering. This pic is brand new.

"@nextspaceflight @chraveesh @Teslarati No, they’re SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time."
"@chraveesh @Teslarati Yes, we’re tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering &amp; building a heavy duty planisher to flatten &amp; cold work the weld area"
"@Teslarati That said, although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it’s built inside a factory in volume."
"@Teslarati This isn’t quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that’s 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures &amp; welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving."

"@flcnhvy @Tesla @thirdrowtesla Ok sure 😀 Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldn’t be thought of as USA only. Also, work location can be Bay Area (preferred), but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory."

"@SPEXcast @SciGuySpace What’s amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity."
"@SPEXcast @SciGuySpace Densification isn’t needed to return the ship &amp; limited cargo from Mars, but it’s an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed"
"@SciGuySpace Fundamental issue with SLS is that it’s not reusable, which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch! 💯 tragedy."
"@SciGuySpace Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!"

"@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4."

"@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts &amp; better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight."

@Kristennetten @SmileSimplify @Erdayastronaut We’re focusing on Boca right now for Starship &amp; Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon
@Erdayastronaut Spin start from COPVs so the ox &amp; fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.
"@SmileSimplify @Erdayastronaut Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc &amp; steel melt pool."
"@Erdayastronaut No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 &amp; O2 from Raptor"
@teslaownersSV @TonyCrisostomo @Erdayastronaut Yeah
"@Erdayastronaut Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts &amp; fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020."
"@Erdayastronaut Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed &amp; TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints &amp; 20% mass reduction."
"@DJSnM We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome."

"@JonAttenborough @cFidd Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else &amp; directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them."
@ollie_turrell @cFidd Pretty much

"@cFidd No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic &amp; it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is."
"@RationalEtienne @EvaFoxU @amargosavalley That might have something to do with it. “Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar” was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they’d listened to Lenin’s last wish, much tragedy may have been averted."

"@flcnhvy @Sofiaan @Erdayastronaut It’s not that these things can’t be done, they just absorb a lot of software engineering time, which has great opportunity cost. There are very few excellent software engineers &amp; merely increasing team size results in awful bloatware."

"@Sofiaan @Erdayastronaut Possible, but one step at a time. Anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. For example, if someone’s on data roaming &amp; video is enabled, they will get a giant cell phone bill. Operating in 40+ countries results in many corner cases!"
"@JeremyGreenlee @mobiledavidd Seeing B pillar (diagonal fwd) &amp; side repeater (diagonal back) camera views would probably help for tight situations. We can enable access to these views. Also, no problem to have option to disable auto lock for home."

@stephenjudkins @flcnhvy Yes
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
"@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year."
"@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!"
@jchybow @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Pretty much
"@leo_cadle @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Exactly! It’s also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far)."
"@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That’s the sales pitch. Want to go?"
"@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable"
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy As the planets align only once every two years
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
@Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what’s hard.
"@flcnhvy Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half"
"@flcnhvy If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that’s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year"
"@flcnhvy Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it’s designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year"
@flcnhvy The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars

@WillFealey @Teslarati Fair point. Coming soon. We’re making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. 2FA right after that.
"@Teslarati Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software."
@cleantechnica More to come
@bob_burrough Yes
@rafaelcr @OfWudan Would be odd to expect anything else
"@TJ_Cooney That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth"
"@TJ_Cooney Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed."
@flcnhvy Great poem

"@MartianDays @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @AerojetRdyne We def could be wrong about this, but it’s actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don’t need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower."
"@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Also, we’re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that’s leaving a lot on the table"
"@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec."
"@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now."
@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2.  https://t.co/LijrUMuJDq

"@J_ump_er @neiltyson @Space_Station To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth.  https://t.co/21hICWczMq"

"@Kalzsom @Erdayastronaut For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure."
"@Erdayastronaut Current analysis, which I’m not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2"
"@Erdayastronaut Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward “fin” would simply be used as a leg."

"@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK &amp; Ireland right now, but we don’t raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win."
"@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners That’s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I’m looking into it"
"@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances."
"@Kristennetten @Model3Owners The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world."

"@hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval."
"@Teslatunity @Model3Owners There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all."

@SpaceXFan97 @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower &amp; Starship doesn’t have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
@lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut You’re touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We’re fixing that with Starship.
"@baconmashwbs @Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney’s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you’d exit on another continent."
"@Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin ~1000, as all seats would be “coach” &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It’s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands."
"@YusifzadaAgshin About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips."
"@Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher &amp; stability of booster in ground winds is low"

@Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy It’s a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
"@Elthiryel @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor."
"@SpaceXFan97 @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more"
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.

"@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1."

"@HarryStoltz1 @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year."
"@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year."

"@TeslaAnswers @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag We’re going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot &amp; fast, so dicey."
"@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Annoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can’t. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that’s very rare."
"@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last year’s vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer &amp; max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying."
"@Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Probably no fairing either &amp; just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see what’s there. Not impossible."
"@emilmelar Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it’s slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2."

"Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward “HW3” will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important."

"@Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing ☺️High engine chamber pressure and ablative don’t get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage."
"@sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey That’s true 😀 Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there."
"@Erdayastronaut @MarekCyzio @katlinegrey Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for “launch capability”. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that."
@Geopilot @katlinegrey Don’t know
"@katlinegrey SpaceX commercial 🚀 launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years.  https://t.co/sqAYCCcJtd"
"@martinengwicht @macodiseas @katlinegrey Exactly. That’s the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species."
"@fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I’m worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics."

@SpaceXFan97 @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX Yes
"@Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX This will sound implausible, but I think there’s a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9"
@13ericralph31 @John_Gardi @SpaceX Close
"@John_Gardi @SpaceX But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter."
@SpaceXFan97 @alexmd2 @SpaceX Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
"@_cgp @SpaceX Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy."
"@John_Gardi @SpaceX Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky."

"@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Rocket booster temperatures won’t go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind."

@Robotbeat @zackpio Actual tanks are fine
"@Teslarati ~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel."
@nextspaceflight @Teslarati I just heard. 50 mph winds broke the mooring blocks late last night &amp; fairing was blown over. Will take a few weeks to repair.
"@Teslarati 310S stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 Kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate 300 degrees of delta temp"

"@MattRemp Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees."
"@martinengwicht @realkrauswife Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces."
"@ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they’re right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."
"@FredericLambert @boringcompany You’re right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn’t include it. We’re working on one that makes things clear."
"@realkrauswife Pop up, park and walk!"
@realkrauswife I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.

"@business Incorrect. “Chairman” is an honorific, not executive role, which means it’s not needed to run Tesla. Will retire that title at Tesla in 3 years. 60 Mins edited out end of my sentence, where I said I could do whatever I want. They cut “provided I have the support of shareholders”."
@annerajb About 10 to 14 days
"Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)"
"Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks.   To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at  https://t.co/46TXqRJ3C1 or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla can’t deliver your car this year."
@erikstorli No need to wait. It’s super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.
@lgebman I’m dying to make a pickup truck so bad … we might have a prototype to unveil next year
@jpjstevenson Yes
"Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they don’t believe in climate change.   Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they don’t need to be."
@vincent13031925 @teslectrics @60Minutes @MKBHD Probably next month
@teslectrics @60Minutes You’re right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with @MKBHD tell a more interesting story.

@cleantechnica Interesting
"@Erdayastronaut @TheGledinator @w00ki33 @Teslarati Fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong"
@Erdayastronaut @TheGledinator @w00ki33 @Teslarati The new design is metal
"@Erdayastronaut @w00ki33 @Teslarati As far as we know, it’s the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint."
Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars &amp; ground to tunnel car elevators.
Tracking shot of Falcon water landing  https://t.co/6Hv2aZhLjM
"Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon.  https://t.co/O3h8eCgGJ7"
"@DJSnM Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines."
@Dragonmaurizio We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
"@markkrieger Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad."
"Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged &amp; is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched."

@bonnienorman @carpenter_maas Good advice
@EESNY @teslaownersSV @S100Dfan Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We’re also working on vision-only driving.
@nikesharora @Tesla Glad you’re ok
"@carpenter_maas Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth."
"@carpenter_maas As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic."

"Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage &amp; Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)"
Renaming BFR to Starship
"@universal_sci No, we’re just going to accelerate BFR"
@YoBigBrotha Yes
"Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster"
Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
"@scottymeuk @ScaleyMurrsuit No, it’s got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered."
"@FredericLambert @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast"
"@tsrandall @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output."
"@frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit Lot on our plate, so it’s either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster."
@frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit Ok
@ScaleyMurrsuit Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That’s a great van. We will inquire.
@WillFealey Absolutely agree
@WillFealey Investigating
@vincent13031925 @jsteinerman Probably mid 2019
@LION_LIFER Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
"@WillFealey Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not."
@acevedo_lex @stars4a_amy @Tesla Should be possible. Please ask service &amp; lmk response.
"@ajaotj36 No, but perhaps in a few years"
"@stars4a_amy Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app."
"@jsteinerman Haha, just like Super Troopers"
@WillFealey Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner
Will allow having your car picked up &amp; dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isn’t needed
Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps
"@FrameshiftShark Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA &amp; USAF are supportive."
@FrameshiftShark Radical change
"Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive."
@annerajb It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
"Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times."

@pmcollins @cleantechnica Exactly. There are many states where we are not allowed to sell cars at all or are severely restricted to literally one store.
"@cleantechnica Model 3 was top-selling car in US by revenue despite no advertising, no paid endorsements &amp; no discounts. Competitors spent billions on marketing. Model 3 was product alone."
Massive thanks to Tesla owners &amp; supporters. We wouldn’t be here without you.

"@houmanhemmati @FredericLambert There have been hundreds of improvements to fit &amp; finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. Seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past."
@FredericLambert Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
@FredericLambert Just did that to correct the front design esthetic of Model S. The nose of an electric car shouldn’t look like a radiator grill opening.
"Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that there’s no such thing as a Tesla “refresh”. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week."
"To simplify production, many Tesla Model S &amp; X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want."
"@cleantechnica Model 3 body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars"

"Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow &amp; ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just don’t use sport/summer tires."
"@DannyMekic It’s a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high, but we can get it done now instead of ~February"

@Erdayastronaut @smeranda New Summon will use the Autopilot cameras
"@smeranda Yes, aiming for next few months"
"@ajmarquez True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time."
Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
Just reviewed Tesla’s service locations in North America &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.
Insightful article by David @Pogue
"@ID_AA_Carmack Thanks John, really admire you too! I think you’re one of the best engineers ever. Hope you return to working on rockets one day."
@JacksMacintosh @SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
@SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert I believe it’s $5k
@SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
@j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Somewhere between 500% &amp; 2000%
"@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU."
"@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude."
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Still a long way to go
Model 3 motor &amp; gearbox still in good condition after driving 1M miles. Designed for ultra high endurance.

@martyeuler @MebFaber Fair point 😀
"@MebFaber When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they’re just “passive” managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!"
"@MebFaber Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative — it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide.  https://t.co/7jk2Bs56HR"
@Model3Owners V9 moving to wide release now. Holding back Autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. Extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere.

"@annerajb @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman The big funds can &amp; will, as they’re suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for “passive” index tracking."
"@dlauer @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder"
"@KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return."
"@KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators"
@Erdayastronaut I hope to be less wrong over time
@FlintSchools @MuskFoundation You’re most welcome. Hope to do more to help in the future.

"@LanceUlanoff Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car."
"@LanceUlanoff Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good."
@LanceUlanoff Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at  https://t.co/CftQ1v9YCL
"@LanceUlanoff Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric."
@martinengwicht @BlondesE A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
"@LanceUlanoff Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side"
"@LanceUlanoff Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts"
Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details
"@MartenBenjamin @NHTSAgov @Tesla Exactly, all 5 star are *not* the same, as the videos show. “5 star” just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much."

Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed.  https://t.co/t5XRo3gTxK
@slashdot Yes
@dirkbonhomme @JelteDesign @maysacha Yes
@JelteDesign @maysacha Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights &amp; adjust bouyancy.
@abroadwithalec @maysacha Yes
"@maysacha 4 handles/hitch points on front &amp; 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front &amp; 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops."
@thanr @ablack82 I’m in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
"@aiyanaskye Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand"
"Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best."
"Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust."
@VoltzCoreAudio Ground winds would
@VoltzCoreAudio Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. It’s a beast.
@jevjack1 Can’t be too buoyant
"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."
@ArkadiuszKula @JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Good idea
"@JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack."
@LittleMissFlint You’re welcome. Happy birthday! 🎁🎉🎂
"@MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about in that tweet — double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying."
@williamwinters @austinhopperrrr @maysacha @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.
@jeremysliew It’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
"@siwgrindaker @erikveen Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
@erikveen I would def recommend this
@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
@bonnienorman @TeslaBull @trippedover Interesting
"@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Great, thanks"
@JamesWorldSpace Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
"@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water won’t come in"
"@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
@JamesWorldSpace SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
"@JamesWorldSpace Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit."
"@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power."
@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
"@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you’re in an air tube, time doesn’t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
@JamesWorldSpace Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
@cate_long @lopezlinette Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for &amp; parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.

"@vincent13031925 @TeslaBull @scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette So @lopezlinette publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Tesla’s most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is “one of the greatest.” Her articles print Chanos’s view verbatim. This is not journalism."
"@scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette .@lopezlinette You stated publicly that you “see eye to eye” with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?"
@TeslaBull What a coincidence …
@thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews Am not attacking all media or even all of @CNBC. Just asked if you inform public about an analyst’s prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
"@stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: @lopezlinette, did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?"
"@benjaminpollock @CNBC Exactly. @cnbc, I just asked a simple question. Please answer."
"@ICannot_Enough @SimRiyat @gawwy @aperezposada @Reuters @sal19 Strange. @cnbc, is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst’s track record before hearing their opinion."
"Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself.  https://t.co/xSG2Mmy756"

"@S_Padival @lopezlinette has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &amp;3 production number, which is physically impossible."
"@gawwy @aperezposada @Reuters @sal19 Wow, so @sal19 of @Reuters wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work @sal19 &amp; @Reuters."
"@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number?"
"@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target."

@PPathole @dawg_fan_93 @maysacha @JayPrisefighter @cfarivar It’s actually way better than the factory building. More comfortable &amp; a great view of the mountains.
@maysacha @JayPrisefighter @cfarivar Not sure we actually need a building. This tent is pretty sweet. Tesla Grohmann line is in place at Giga &amp; spooling up now. They super kicked ass too. Heiliger Strohsack!
@JayPrisefighter @cfarivar They also poured the concrete &amp; built the whole assembly line using scrap we had in warehouses. And it’s way better than the other GA line that cost hundreds of millions!

"@doctorow @dimas_______ @Robotbeat Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread."
@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
@TeslaCharts How big is your short position? Just curious.
@BobbieBees @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. This one guy’s claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
"@doctorow I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right."
"@dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow UAW doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they’re getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps."
"@TheSithSeth @doctorow I’m not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can’t compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don’t want Tesla to die too."

"@Josh_Soto Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now."
@zacharyj98 Good idea ...
@MacTechGenius That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.
@PPathole Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3: 3.5 sec  0-60mph  155 mph Top Speed 310 mile Range"
"@plot_qasc It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
@clemyeung Exactly
Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork.
@Everman @scottwww @KymmPuckeridge @ElementC9 @griff_golf I’m about to test the configurator &amp; then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight

"@Kasabiii It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released."
What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
"It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage  https://t.co/6gD8MzD6VU"
@sokane1 @TalkTesla @Techmeme @timkhiggins Yes
"@TalkTesla @Techmeme @timkhiggins According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It’s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
"@Techmeme @timkhiggins This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg."

"@AnthonyFultz @DMC_Ryan I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp"
@DMC_Ryan Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD &amp; performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.

"@joshgans We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom."
"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0."
"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"
"The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors"

"@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV To be clear, I’m a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification"
"@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV The “dry” questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them."

"@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not."
"@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy."

@B_Rans yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
@gerardomarina Some tweaking underway
@HBL_Cosmin Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.
@MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
@scottkelley99 Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.

"@JimmyVosika Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed."
"If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."
@mbhnyc steel collet
"Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing.  https://t.co/w007TccANJ"
@Uncle_Gus probably
"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating."
Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.

@truth_tesla @LimitingThe Our new cell is 46mm diameter with steel shell &amp; even that was huge challenge for propagation resistance
"@truth_tesla @LimitingThe Yes.   Physics of large cells means distance from cooling loop to center of cell is high, so harder to prevent hotspots.  Then, pressure &amp; heat released from large cell in weak bag make it impossible to stop whole pack from burning.  Pretty basic."

"@wapodavenport However, even if it were 16 flights with docking, this is not a problem. SpaceX did more than 16 orbital flights in first half of 2021 &amp; has docked with Station (much harder than docking with our own ship) over 20 times."
"@wapodavenport 16 flights is extremely unlikely. Starship payload to orbit is ~150 tons , so max of 8 to fill 1200 ton tanks of lunar Starship.  Without flaps &amp; heat shield, Starship is much lighter. Lunar landing legs don’t add much (1/6 gravity). May only need 1/2 full, ie 4 tanker flights."

@BBCAmos @NASASpaceflight Ok
"@WholeMarsBlog @NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Higher structural margins overall are needed for reuse, plus:  Booster - Grid fins for aero control - Boostback &amp; landing propellant tanks - Protecting engines from entry loads  Ship - Body flaps for aero control - Deorbit &amp; landing propellant tanks - Heat shield"
@Astro_Elliott @NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Inevitably
"@NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Over time, we might get orbital payload up to ~150 tons with full reusabity. If Starship then launched as an expendable, payload would be ~250 tons. What isn’t obvious from this chart is that Starship/Super Heavy is much denser than Saturn V."

@NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal Sure
"@Adamklotz_ @PPathole Good idea. They are not easy to move over roads, which is why the factory is close to the launch site, but we will support a museum that wants a prototype if they take care of transport."
@PPathole Most people have no idea Starship exists or how large this beast is!  Body diameter (9m or 30 ft) is bigger than a 747 or A380. Starship thrust &amp; mass are more than double Saturn V moon rocket.  Making life multiplanetary means massive rockets. Got to be done.

@Erdayastronaut @Model3Owners How about a wifi camera link?
"@BLKMDL3 @Model3Owners In end, we kept production design almost exactly same as show car. Just some small tweaks here &amp; there to make it slightly better.  No door handles. Car recognizes you &amp; opens door.  Having all four wheels steer is amazing for nimble handling &amp; tight turns!"
@johnkrausphotos @SpaceX @PortCanaveral Version 3 of the SpaceX droneship. Team did great work! Will be epic to see the deep sea oil rigs converted to ocean spaceports for Starship.
"@Model3Owners To be frank, there is always some chance that Cybertruck will flop, because it is so unlike anything else.   I don’t care. I love it so much even if others don’t.   Other trucks look like copies of the same thing, but Cybertruck looks like it was made by aliens from the future."
"@TesLatino @klwtts @jpr007 Tapering down charge rate is simply a physical thing that has to happen, as lithium ions bounce around what is an increasingly full “parking lot”.   Just like a car parking lot, where it takes longer to find a spot when the lot is almost full."
"@jpr007 Not bad, although new Model S has more range &amp; faster charging. 3 &amp; Y should use long range version, as Performance version is meant for max speed &amp; handling, not max range.   Supercharger network is being upgraded to 250kW to 300kW, so that will help too."

@PPathole Yeah
"@PPathole @Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX Laser links in orbit can reduce long-distance latency by as much as 50%, due to higher speed of light in vacuum &amp; shorter path than undersea fiber"
"@Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX More ground stations &amp; less foolish packet routing will make the biggest differences.

@Adamklotz_ @mrgreyev @DirtyTesla @Tesla Sure. We can show them live. Eerily realistic. Maybe we should make a game.
"@mrgreyev @DirtyTesla @Tesla When we need strange training examples, eg half a car on highway, Tesla sim delivers.   Also, accidents on Autopilot are becoming rarer, so we need more close call examples.  For safety tests, Autopilot sees dummy far away. Emergency braking only needed for distracted drivers."
@RenataKonkoly @thesheetztweetz @rookisaacman @johnkrausphotos @wapodavenport @blueorigin But can I pay in Doge?
"@DirtyTesla @Tesla Yeah, it’s next-level &amp; will just keep getting better with more training data from fleet. Tesla sim team is also crushing it."
@AngelNDevil2 @torybruno But I guess I should take my own advice &amp; just work on saving the things I love
"@AngelNDevil2 @torybruno What is not well understood is that ULA *still* has a monopoly carve-out for US government launches for which SpaceX is not allowed to compete, costing the taxpayer twice as much per launch than it should. This is obviously not real competition."
"@torybruno Your company said the exact opposite in 2014 when it got a sole-source, uncompeted $11B DoD launch contract.  https://t.co/Abd5sWhZDt  In any event, expendable rockets are as relevant to the future as expendable aircraft. Rapidly reusable rockets are all that matter."
@SciGuySpace True
@thesheetztweetz Will look pretty wild with a ship on top
Super Heavy on road &amp; 7th Tower segment added  https://t.co/SJIHA3BLhL
"@Astro_Elliott @LifeboatHQ Once you have rapidly reusable rockets of sufficient size to carry &gt;100 tons of payload, it is not clear that cost per ton to orbit/moon/Mars improves with a larger rocket.   Aircraft, for example, have moved away from 747/A380 to 777, which has ~100 tons of payload."
@_TomCross_ Million tons to Mars requires R R R
Super Heavy moves tomorrow  https://t.co/qHG1SYO46S
"@LifeboatHQ Doubling diameter increases mass 4X, but difficulty of simultaneously building &amp; launching rocket of that size is &gt;&gt;4X.   In retrospect, &lt;9m diameter for Starship might have been wise. Current size is ~5200 ton stack mass &amp; ~7500 ton-F thrust, which is more than double Saturn V."
"Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, Baby Doge"
@KerbalSpaceP What are we doing wrong at SpaceX? You probably have some good ideas.   The fundamental optimization for making life multiplanetary &amp; backing up the biosphere is cost per ton to the surface of Mars.   What system achieves that best?

@Erdayastronaut Impressive
@AstroKevin_133 @torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz Then why were taxpayers forced to overpay for ULA?
"@torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz Now, this sort of nonsense happens all the time with government contracts &amp; everyone knows it.   However, in this case, it is money diverted from making life multiplanetary, which is the goal of SpaceX, vs the ULA goal of maximizing dividends to Lockheed &amp; Boeing.  Not ok."
"@dogeofficialceo @torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz Yeah, but dogz rūl"
"@torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz ULA would be dead as a doornail without the two launch provider DoD requirement.   If this is not true, then you won’t have a problem removing it.  Your parent company, Lockheed, darkened the skies with lobbyists to ensure F-35 was single source.   Seems a little inconsistent …"
@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
"@thesheetztweetz Work needed between flights is less &amp; less, as shown by shortening time between reflights. Required work between flights for Starship &amp; Super Heavy is zero."
@EZebroni @WholeMarsBlog You should notice several other improvements
"Rapidly Reusable Rockets, R R R 🏴‍☠️"
"@Erdayastronaut We’ve already done a lot of iteration on ship. For rapid reusability, booster must return to launchpad, so inert mass impacts ascent, boostback &amp; landing burns. Triple whammy. Also, booster flight rate is ~5X that of ship, so multiple mass $ cost by 5."
"@RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut First one to fly will, so Booster 4. Booster 3 will be used for ground tests. We’re changing much of design from 3 to 4. Booster 3 was very hard to build. Expect especially rapid evolution in first ~10 boosters &amp; first ~30 ships."
"@Erdayastronaut Great shot! Btw, Starship Super Heavy will not have an entry burn. Delta-v is shifted more to the ship, so booster entry Q &amp; heating is lower."
@PPathole @Tesla @SpaceX Basic MRI is easier than it sounds good tbh. High resolution MRI in short time with weak magnetic field is hard.
"@weezilla @SpacePadreIsle Actually, almost 80% liquid oxygen"
"@torybruno @Dynetics Should I bring a few spare engines … I mean, just in case."
@torybruno @Dynetics Sure
@PassionFlix @ToscaMusk I liked your movie “Hollywood Dirt”!
"@nextspaceflight There is the internal goal if things go right, which needs to be aggressive. Obviously, some things will not go right internally &amp; there will be external issues too.   That said, I think we can stack an orbital ship on an orbital booster in July."
@torybruno @Dynetics When do the engines arrive? 😉
"@SpaceX Unfortunately, launch is called off for today, as an aircraft entered the “keep out zone”, which is unreasonably gigantic.   There is simply no way that humanity can become a spacefaring civilization without major regulatory reform. The current regulatory system is broken."
@SpaceX Sonic boom incoming  https://t.co/jWAyA0j5Xx

@ajtourville The Plaid carbon-wrapped motor is arguably the most advanced motor on Earth outside of maybe a lab somewhere. We have to keep some secrets!   We have a few ideas for increasing torque &amp; max rpm even further for new Roadster. Definitely fun &amp; exciting engineering ahead!
"@ajtourville Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel).   Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration."
@ajtourville Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation.  Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion.   Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator.

"Powerwall 2 peak &amp; steady power capability is better than advertised.   Now that we have lots of operational data, Tesla can unlock higher capabilities for free via software update next month.   Depending on production date, power increase power may be &gt;50% at 30C ambient temp."
"Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts."
"Starting next week, Tesla Solar Panels &amp; Solar Roof will only be sold as an integrated product *with* Tesla Powerwall battery"
"@wintonARK Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.  Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp; can stabilize grid."

Starbase will grow by several thousand people over the next year or two
@OwenSparks_ I sure hope so!
"@OwenSparks_ Agreed! We’re not super far, as Magic Valley Utility can give us almost all wind-power, which will be used for LOX (78% of propellant mass)/N2/argon distillation. We’re also aiming to increase solar power from 1MW to 10MW, paired with Tesla Megapacks, for continuous power."

"@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX BN1 is a manufacturing pathfinder, so will be scrapped. We learned a lot, but have already changed design to BN2.   Goal is to get BN2 with engines on orbital pad before end of April. It might even be orbit-capable if we are lucky."
"Please consider moving to Starbase or greater Brownsville/South Padre area in Texas &amp; encourage friends to do so!   SpaceX’s hiring needs for engineers, technicians, builders &amp; essential support personnel of all kinds are growing rapidly."
@CodingMark @Adamklotz_ @SpaceX More like V10.0
"@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX Next major technology rev is at SN20. Those ships will be orbit-capable with heat shield &amp; stage separation system. Ascent success probability is high.  However, SN20+ vehicles will probably need many flight attempts to survive Mach 25 entry heating &amp; land intact."
"@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX SN15 rolls to launch pad in a few days. It has hundreds of design improvements across structures, avionics/software &amp; engine.   Hopefully, one of those improvements covers this problem. If not, then retrofit will add a few more days."
"@SpaceX Looks like engine 2 had issues on ascent &amp; didn’t reach operating chamber pressure during landing burn, but, in theory, it wasn’t needed.   Something significant happened shortly after landing burn start. Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today."

@TezlaMick @arstechnica @SciGuySpace Yes
"@arstechnica @SciGuySpace Falcon 9 is almost always at max capacity. When it has “spare” performance, it flies back to land, which costs much less than using a droneship.  Our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit time. Last year, SpaceX launched roughly double payload mass of rest of world."

"@PPathole I was just up there. Elevator on the other side. Floor is in, glass coming soon."
"@Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @NASASpaceflight Yeah, we talked about that internally. Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity, but would work. But, optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass, so it’s not a gamechanger."

@ashleevance Battery energy density is the key to electric aircraft. Autonomy for aircraft could have been done a long time ago. Modern airliners are very close to autonomous.

"@NASASpaceflight Fair point. If autogenous pressurization had been used, CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid.   Helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh, which happened in prior flight. My fault for approving. Sounded good at the time."

"@RationalEtienne @Adamklotz_ Starlink is a staggeringly difficult technical &amp; economic endeavor. However, if we don’t fail, the cost to end users will improve every year."
@RationalEtienne @Adamklotz_ SpaceX needs to pass through a deep chasm of negative cash flow over the next year or so to make Starlink financially viable. Every new satellite constellation in history has gone bankrupt. We hope to be the first that does not.

"@Adamklotz_ @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Will still use hot gas maneuvering (RCS) thrusters, as ~5X more efficient than nitrogen (300 sec vs 60 sec Isp)"
@Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Higher Isp too
"@Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Intuitively, it would seem so, but turbopump-fed Raptors have much higher thrust &amp; propellant mass fraction than pressure-fed gas thrusters &amp; they’re already there"

"@josh_bickett @ajtourville @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yeah. By default, engine with least lever arm would shut down if all 3 are good."
"@ajtourville @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes, but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk, so landing on 3 engines means high thrust/weight (further away from hover point), which is also risky"

@Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame Tom has some great stories about experimenting with premixed O2/CH4 before SpaceX. That is not recommended haha.
"@Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame He became a big fan of methane, but was not pushing it initially. That came from me reading about Soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 Isp. At that Isp, a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-V than a hydrogen stage."
@TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame That sounds correct. Tom certainly deserves a lot of credit for his excellent work on those engines! Dean Ono too for Kestrel &amp; Draco.
"@TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame Tom is great &amp; was instrumental in developing early versions of Merlin &amp; Kestrel, but not later versions of Merlin or Starship/Raptor"
"@ErcXspace @smvllstvrs T/W will be ~1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. For expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low T/W."

"@WholeMarsBlog @tkrisher He’s actually a lobbyist, not a journalist. There are many who pose as the latter while behaving like the former. No integrity.  Indeed, there were no safety issues. The car simply slowed to ~2 mph &amp; continued forward if clear view with no cars or pedestrians."
@TeslaOwnersUK Yes
