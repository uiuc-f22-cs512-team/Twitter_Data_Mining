0,"There are certain moments when Matthews touches the puck in the offensive zone when you can confidently say ""yeah, he'll score"" when he winds up for the shot. That 1-0 goal was certainly one of them.",1535472196084068352
1,@derekw306 Is that the case? I've found other games later than 24 hours after the fact.,1535472196084068352
2,@risingaction It's shocking. The league should really step in. No way this fills the void left by NHL Live.,1535472196084068352
3,"Anybody with Sportsnet Now premium, can you check to see if any of the nationally-televised games from Wednesday night are available for you? I couldn't load the Canucks-Sharks game to track it last night.",1535472196084068352

5,"Also, I strongly encourage everybody to avoid any sort of prop bet that is based on the judgment from the un-audited scorekeepers. Goals and assists are checked and re-checked and corrected. Shots, blocks, hits, takeaways... aren't. There are a dozen mistakes a game.",1535472196084068352
6,"Hilariously, Michael Bunting had a rebound follow-up after the Tavares shot. Instead of being tagged as a rebound shot, it counted as a ""rush"" shot on NST because the Dallas scorekeeper tagged the previous play seconds earlier about 150 feet away from where it actually took place",1535472196084068352
7,"The xG of the shot, based on what we have from the NHL, is not only 0 (because it's a blocked shot), but it's also -1 corsi for the Leafs, since the play was incorrectly marked as a Tavares block of a Heiskanen shot.",1535472196084068352
8,"To close the loop on this one, it looks like my followers have, on average, pegged the xG of this shot at about 13.7%, which seems a LITTLE high but probably within the actual range.",1535472196084068352
9,@JFreshHockey I think there's a tendency among scorekeepers to credit shots that go in as being closer than those that are saved. Witness where Caufield's goal against Vancouver was recorded from versus where the shot was actually taken.,1535472196084068352
10,"@Account4hockey Well, yes",1535472196084068352
11,"@Esch87 @mirtle The linesman is very clearly watching the puck though, plus Forbort isn't all that fast. Maybe it's because Forbort pulled up a little at the end, but either way I'd like for a journalist to be able to ask what the linesman was looking for when he waved it off.",1535472196084068352
12,"@sprotsplease I cracked the code a few years ago. If the linesman is yelling at the player to ""get the line"" and he doesn't cross the red line, it's icing. If the linesman doesn't, he gets a few feet of grace.",1535472196084068352

18,"@sprotsplease @JasonVDE @patersonjeff Maybe. I think he has slowed down a fair bit (he's frequently caught in situations where I'm not used to him being caught) and he's not working with teammates that understand how to take advantage of it.

I get that he's producing, but he doesn't seem like the same player, to me.",1535472196084068352
19,"@JasonVDE @patersonjeff I'm not sure. In Toronto, a lot of his breakaways were created off loose pucks or pucks thrown to open space. It happened with regularity.",1535472196084068352
20,"@garik16 I think after the 32 games from non-Conference teams and 45 games from Conference teams, the remaining 5 games should be distributed based on classic or playoff rivalries. Maybe toss in an extra home-and-home for an opposite conference team.",1535472196084068352
21,"@garik16 It was the case last season too. 2 games against teams in the other conference, 3 games against conference opponents, and an extra game against 5 divisional teams.",1535472196084068352
22,"But, Cam, how does this affect the Leafs? 

Well, I hypothesize that some of the better defensive teams in the NHL are quite good at cutting down on the time opposing teams have before shooting, which makes life easy for the goalies.

https://t.co/kktakF0iK4",1535472196084068352
23,"What a fantastic shot (and great jerseys as well). It's clear that even from tough angles, you can't give elite players in this league any time and space. So many players can pick corners like this. https://t.co/bVBR4ynhrc",1535472196084068352

25,"Also, I was tallying up some of my tracked numbers and Engvall has been really good. Post up this weekend or early next week detailing why I think so.",1535472196084068352
26,This is fair. Anything more than Kuznetsov's slash on Burroughs earlier this season (which was much more vicious and somehow only drew two minutes plus one game https://t.co/pOI68iKsvB) would have been out of line. https://t.co/rWWifXaJy6,1535472196084068352
27,@bruce_arthur That some of the movie took place in a parallel universe where Michelle Yeoh's character was actually Michelle Yeoh was brilliant. I don't think I'll ever experience a movie like that ever again. I walked into the theatre knowing nothing about it.,1535472196084068352
28,"On the gamefinder page (credit where it's due, it's a welcome addition and makes finding games a lot easier), they have one link to the English broadcast and one for the French and don't tell you which is which. https://t.co/gnUnEN1sUu",1535472196084068352
29,I've never been a fan of the defensive player lying down behind the wall on free kicks and I hope that the trend dies a swift death following that tying goal.,1535472196084068352
30,@VinceRusso5 Working for me. What are you using?,1535472196084068352
31,"Murray and Samsonov are playing well, but I think the Leafs defence creates a much easier environment for goalies to thrive than people may think.

32,"On one hand, Sh% regresses. On the other hand, external inputs matter. Matthews' shots over the last couple of weeks have been much more dangerous and plentiful than the two weeks or so leading up to that post.",1535472196084068352

37,"@DBlye @DownGoesBrown I live with a Warriors fan, so certain basketball series in the late teens are off-limits as conversation topics.",1535472196084068352
38,"@DownGoesBrown It's really incredible how that series is still going on, 12 years later. Has there been any other championship game or series in any other sport that provided so much drama in the ensuing years?",1535472196084068352
39,@Leafs_25 I think what made the goaltending performance so devastating last season was that it happened behind good defence.,1535472196084068352
40,"Still, the Bruins formula has worked pretty well. Have a few players that dominate, and break even when they're off the ice. As long as that GF% in the second chart stays above 50%, the Bruins are in great shape.",1535472196084068352
41,"Looking at @shawnferris98 tracked Bruins data, no players that aren't usual suspects are really having a dominant season in transition, except maybe Coyle.",1535472196084068352
42,"I put more stock in GF% than SCF% when it comes to elite players but less so when it's the non-elite guys. Hampus Lindholm is a great back who elevates his team's offence, but he isn't that good.",1535472196084068352
43,"The Bruins leader in points rate isn't Pastrnak, or Marchand. It's Trent Frederic. Guys like him, Coyle, Zacha, even Foligno are having career seasons.",1535472196084068352
44,"Now, look at the Bruins when all of the big three is off the ice. Not a huge change in SCF%, but that GF% is way up: https://t.co/MZY2bcBxwn",1535472196084068352
45,"One thing to note is that the Bruins don't seem to suffer at all when the line is split. Any combination of those three players over the last five seasons has been good regardless. Either way, they're still trucking along, having a great season.",1535472196084068352
46,Talked about the Bruins a bit on @DailyFaceoff and wanted to show you guys something interesting. Here's the Bruins in terms of SCF% and GF% (per @NatStatTrick) when at least one of the big three is on the ice: https://t.co/VYcvrWalH0,1535472196084068352
47,"He also leads the team in turnovers forced in the opponent's defensive zone.

Intelligence is a trait that doesn't fade with age, and I think Tavares is learning to use his strength and frame, rather than speed, to create space for himself and his linemates.",1535472196084068352
48,"The comments on Tavares' transition game are important. He's 2nd on the Leafs in both controlled exit and controlled entry percentage, by my tracking. I don't have last year's numbers but I'm quite confident he was not that. https://t.co/lPhicrFbsY",1535472196084068352

14,@CaligulaIII @rik1981007 @SmallsTayvia @moatxsx platform Sony said no (obviously as it would make MS money) MS subscription service is simply more accessible and is better than Sonys. A 10-20 dollar monthly fee is better for the general consumer than paying $70 multiple times a year,146953720

22,@CaligulaIII @rik1981007 @SmallsTayvia @moatxsx That‚Äôs the thing right there they care about making money the way to do that is by progressing gaming and doing what‚Äôs best for gamers and Microsoft recognises this hence their desire to progress cloud gaming and making their game pass more attractive,146953720
23,"@CaligulaIII @rik1981007 @SmallsTayvia @moatxsx Picking a side of Sony or Microsoft and being a fanboy in the year 2022 is absurd.

5,@LarsApel Thank you so much for this illuminating tweet.,48669581

13,For me... I'd get Rashford on. Probably for Foden. England need to get a bit more direct.,48669581
14,The problem is that France are obviously 1-0 up and I'd say they look basically as likely to score in the second half as England do. Some of their counters are just one or two touches away from leading to a goal. England will need to be both good and lucky to get back into it...,48669581

0,"@Vmcdade1 @betangel No, I‚Äôm not saying the second is 50%. They‚Äôre independent events. Once he scored the first one he‚Äôs 75% for the second. Just that when you take the two combined, the chances of one or the other not going in is close to 50%. He could have missed the first one and scored the second",228706018
1,@RyanWard_1 If you believe his current success rate is how he‚Äôd run over an extremely large sample.,228706018
2,@BulletRobinson @argyface @jack_govier @sobrickaay And if Irwin had missed his first three how many does he take in his career? Probably gets stopped from taking any more but he still would have been really good at them. Just retired with a 0/3 record.,228706018
3,@Kingwolf84 People only judge whether that happened once they know the result though. Seen managers change the keeper in the 119th minute to try to do exactly that. Sometimes they win and the manager is a genius. Sometimes they lose and the narrative is very different,228706018
4,"@BulletRobinson @argyface @jack_govier @sobrickaay Once the sample is big enough, yes. If you want to conclude a pro who scored 9 of 10 pens in a career was definitely a better than average penalty taker go for it. But you might be wrong.",228706018
5,"@Cuff76 I‚Äôm definitely not implying the second is 50%, that would be ridiculous. Tried to make it clear I meant the chance of at least one or the other missing once we know two are taken. Maybe I didn‚Äôt make that clear enough, been a long day.",228706018
6,@Kingwolf84 And your thoughts on that if she missed would be exactly the same?,228706018
7,"@Vmcdade1 @betangel No, that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying. The result of the first one doesn‚Äôt change (materially at least) the probability of the second being scored. I‚Äôm referring specifically to the percentage of both being scored when we already know two are being taken.",228706018
8,"@BulletRobinson @argyface @jack_govier @sobrickaay Those samples, individually, are all too small though. We‚Äôre just told they were good because of their records. They might have been, but I might be good at tossing coins tomorrow. 

They might have missed their next three if they‚Äôd continued playing and regressed to the mean.",228706018
9,"@Kingwolf84 If the second best taker in the team takes the second one and misses it, after Kane has taken the first so perfectly, the country goes absolutely mad about it for weeks. It can‚Äôt happen and it‚Äôs just outcome bias to suggest it should imo",228706018
10,@SimplyMoney1 I‚Äôm not suggesting it isn‚Äôt. Just what the percentage chance of one or the other having been missed *once we know* he‚Äôs taken two.,228706018
11,"@Cuff76 I‚Äôm not arguing a change in probability for the 2nd. Just that we know he‚Äôs taken two &amp; once we know that the chance of one not being a goal is probably a bit higher than most fans believe, because we‚Äôre brought up being told penalties ‚Äòshould‚Äô be scored rather than how many are.",228706018
12,@JumpsLeft @gamray @Theboyjones70 trying to find a better angle of it now to confirm but to me this looks pretty central? Maybe slightly left of centre but I still think the intention was to go top middle or middle ish and know the keeper isn't going to stand still. I'm not certain though. https://t.co/vtrISTxi8q,228706018
13,@rhino_cullen I think you may have misread my tweet.,228706018
14,"@argyface @jack_govier @sobrickaay but we can amalgamate the results of all the best takers over many years to know the %age of 'the best takers' in total. We can also accept within that there has to be some outliers, we just don't have the sufficient proof to categorically conclude who those are. Kane may be one.",228706018
15,@jonnywest777 if there's not better things to do this evening than argue whether or not 45-55 is close to 50-50 or not we may as well blow up the planet,228706018
16,@PGNTFC that doesn't affect my point as I haven't said the odds of the second are changed by the result of the first. It remains the multiplication of fractions.,228706018
17,@jonnywest777 obviously not because I literally just said it's 45 v 55 that at least one's missed. I'll lay you 4/6 every time though?,228706018
18,"@gamray @Theboyjones70 But I think Kane nailed the mind games before both of them. Made Lloris overthink &amp; go the wrong way with the first, then knows Lloris is thinkiing do I go the same or shall I switch up, either way he dives so if I blast down the middle I definitely score. Just execution stunk.",228706018
19,"@Theboyjones70 it's a fair question but I don't think you can tbh. I get it adds a new dimension, but if the 2nd guy (who was initially deemed a less good taker) misses, the country goes loop about it.",228706018
20,@sobrickaay can you show me a good selection examples of 'the best' with a significant sample size (minimum 100 penalties) who were significantly above that rate?,228706018
21,"Penalties are scored about 75% of the time (even by the best takers). If you take two of them in the same game it's close to 50-50 (45-55ish) that both aren't goals. It's not really 'guts' (guts were needed for the first one too), and it's not even really unlucky. It's maths.",228706018
