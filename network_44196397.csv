24,"26. He added: ‚ÄúWe got Jack on board with implementing this for civic integrity in the near term, but we‚Äôre going to need to make a more robust case to get this into our repertoire of policy remediations ‚Äì especially for other policy domains.‚Äù",289548939
25,"25. Roth wrote: ‚ÄúThe hypothesis underlying much of what we‚Äôve implemented is that if exposure to, e.g., misinformation directly causes harm, we should use remediations that reduce exposure, and limiting the spread/virality of content is a good way to do that.‚Äù",289548939
26,"24. Six days later, in a direct message with an employee on the Health, Misinformation, Privacy, and Identity research team, Roth requested more research to support expanding ‚Äúnon-removal policy interventions like disabling engagements and deamplification/visibility filtering.‚Äù https://t.co/lqiJapHjct",289548939
27,"23. In internal Slack messages, Twitter employees spoke of using technicalities to restrict the visibility of tweets and subjects. Here‚Äôs Yoel Roth, Twitter‚Äôs then Global Head of Trust &amp; Safety, in a direct message to a colleague in early 2021: https://t.co/Li7HDZJtIJ",289548939
28,"22. When Raichik told Twitter that her address had been disseminated she says Twitter Support responded with this message: ""We reviewed the reported content, and didn't find it to be in violation of the Twitter rules."" No action was taken. The doxxing tweet is still up. https://t.co/tUeaBP1bS4",289548939
29,"21. Compare this to what happened when Raichik herself was doxxed on November 21, 2022. A photo of her home with her address was posted in a tweet that has garnered more than 10,000 likes.",289548939
30,20. The committee justified her suspensions internally by claiming her posts encouraged online harassment of ‚Äúhospitals and medical providers‚Äù by insinuating ‚Äúthat gender-affirming healthcare is equivalent to child abuse or grooming.‚Äù,289548939
31,"19. But in an internal SIP-PES memo from October 2022, after her seventh suspension, the committee acknowledged that ‚ÄúLTT has not directly engaged in behavior violative of the Hateful Conduct policy."" See here: https://t.co/d9FGhrnQFE",289548939
32,18. Twitter repeatedly informed Raichik that she had been suspended for violating Twitter‚Äôs policy against ‚Äúhateful conduct.‚Äù,289548939
33,"17. The account‚Äîwhich Chaya Raichik began in November 2020 and now boasts over 1.4 million followers‚Äîwas subjected to six suspensions in 2022 alone, Raichik says. Each time, Raichik was blocked from posting for as long as a week.",289548939
34,16. One of the accounts that rose to this level of scrutiny was @libsoftiktok‚Äîan account that was on the ‚ÄúTrends Blacklist‚Äù and was designated as ‚ÄúDo Not Take Action on User Without Consulting With SIP-PES.‚Äù https://t.co/Vjo6YxYbxT,289548939
35,"15. This is where the biggest, most politically sensitive decisions got made. ‚ÄúThink high follower account, controversial,‚Äù another Twitter employee told us. For these ‚Äúthere would be no ticket or anything.‚Äù",289548939
36,"14. This secret group included Head of Legal, Policy, and Trust (Vijaya Gadde), the Global Head of Trust &amp; Safety (Yoel Roth), subsequent CEOs Jack Dorsey and Parag Agrawal, and others.",289548939
37,"13. But there existed a level beyond official ticketing, beyond the rank-and-file moderators following the company‚Äôs policy on paper. That is the ‚ÄúSite Integrity Policy, Policy Escalation Support,‚Äù known as ‚ÄúSIP-PES.‚Äù",289548939
38,"12. The group that decided whether to limit the reach of certain users was the Strategic Response Team - Global Escalation Team, or SRT-GET. It often handled up to 200 ""cases"" a day.",289548939
39,"11. ‚ÄúWe control visibility quite a bit. And we control the amplification of your content quite a bit. And normal people do not know how much we do,‚Äù one Twitter engineer told us. Two additional Twitter employees confirmed.",289548939
40,10. All without users‚Äô knowledge.,289548939
41,9. ‚ÄúVF‚Äù refers to Twitter‚Äôs control over user visibility. It used VF to block searches of individual users; to limit the scope of a particular tweet‚Äôs discoverability; to block select users‚Äô posts from ever appearing on the ‚Äútrending‚Äù page; and from inclusion in hashtag searches.,289548939
42,"8. ‚ÄúThink about visibility filtering as being a way for us to suppress what people see to different levels. It‚Äôs a very powerful tool,‚Äù one senior Twitter employee told us.",289548939
43,"7. What many people call ‚Äúshadow banning,‚Äù Twitter executives and employees call ‚ÄúVisibility Filtering‚Äù or ‚ÄúVF.‚Äù Multiple high-level sources confirmed its meaning.",289548939
44,"6. Twitter denied that it does such things. In 2018, Twitter's Vijaya Gadde (then Head of Legal Policy and Trust) and Kayvon Beykpour (Head of Product) said: ‚ÄúWe do not shadow ban.‚Äù They added: ‚ÄúAnd we certainly don‚Äôt shadow ban based on political viewpoints or ideology.‚Äù",289548939
45,5. Twitter set the account of conservative activist Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) to ‚ÄúDo Not Amplify.‚Äù https://t.co/dOyQIVdsW2,289548939
46,"4. Or consider the popular right-wing talk show host, Dan Bongino (@dbongino), who at one point was slapped with a ‚ÄúSearch Blacklist.‚Äù https://t.co/AdOK8xLu9v",289548939
47,"3. Take, for example, Stanford‚Äôs Dr. Jay Bhattacharya (@DrJBhattacharya) who argued that Covid lockdowns would harm children. Twitter secretly placed him on a ‚ÄúTrends Blacklist,‚Äù which prevented his tweets from trending. https://t.co/qTW22Zh691",289548939
48,"2. Twitter once had a mission ‚Äúto give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers.‚Äù Along the way, barriers nevertheless were erected.",289548939

96,"produced from the dense energy inside stars that exploded billions of years before the formation of Earth (and were part of our planet's formation), we've always assumed heavier elements here on Earth were fixed natural resources - we can't just make more",16359535

98,"as we move past the 21st century and plasma fusion, like all technologies, becomes faster, cheaper, smaller, better, its application set will expand beyond its original obvious purpose. to what? well, remember, plasma fusion is fundamentally the system of stars...",16359535

9,Those steps take away many of the gratifications of the trolling here. Bans are frustrating and take work (and resources) to try to circumvent; visibility filtering deprives trolls of the attention and reach they're trying to get.,14893345
10,"@evelyndouek We did two main things:

1. Suspending several thousand of the trolling/abusive accounts at the core of the surge.

2. Filtering Tweets that we detect as hateful and abusive. (Being a little vague here to avoid revealing the specific implementations in an adversarial space.) ...",14893345
11,@mgoldstein Important point! I'll try to share a breakdown that gets into this more specifically soon. Obviously that surface matters too; just not parsed out in this graph.,14893345
12,"Update on our efforts to combat hateful conduct: We've not only mitigated the recent surge in harmful behavior, but have reduced impressions on this content in Search by ~95% relative to even prior baseline levels. We're continuing our work to make Twitter safer every day. https://t.co/lK5fMRWCGb https://t.co/g4X6ue0f8W",14893345
13,@GoAngelo I wouldn't agree with that characterization of what I said. More proportionate enforcement for less severe harms doesn't mean reducing the amount of moderation we do.,14893345
14,"@JasonAbbruzzese This is our vision with the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (https://t.co/V8cQWO4gR3) ‚Äî and we already offer leading access, including free access for academics, to all public tweets via our developer APIs (https://t.co/D4qVrSj0WG).",14893345
15,@pwnallthethings Got it - I wasn‚Äôt clear you meant compromise after Blue badging. Agree. There‚Äôs a longer discussion to have about our historical reluctance to automatically lock down notable accounts when we detect suspicious logins; that‚Äôs likely less of a concern for Blue Verification.,14893345
16,"@pwnallthethings This assumes we have no post-verification checks or investigations. Sure, it‚Äôs a threat vector. It‚Äôs also a mitigable one that imposes durable costs on the adversary when caught and shut down. Costs I estimate are higher than the existing buy-a-hacked-blue-check situation.",14893345
17,"@pwnallthethings Not sure I agree. It‚Äôs not just $8 (in the initial implementation): it‚Äôs $8, and a valid credit card that doesn‚Äôt have fraud flags, and an Apple ID that doesn‚Äôt have any fraud flags, and an iOS device‚Ä¶",14893345
18,"@pwnallthethings IMO, it‚Äôs and, not or. You‚Äôre obviously right that account takeover is a major vector for a whole host of bad things. We need to invest there, and are. But we can also broadly raise the costs of spam that actually reaches people via perceived-credible accounts.",14893345
19,"@nicoleperlroth Yep. Or, yknow, all accounts. Google does a great job nudging people towards MFA.",14893345
20,@RMac18 They're still under development. Not trying to evade; just don't want to tell you a bunch of stuff we end up moving away from. Our teams are actively doing threat ideation work to build a broad set of defenses.,14893345
21,"@RMac18 That's not the only safeguard we're planning to implement. But this was already an extremely long thread, so...",14893345
22,"No solution to identity is perfect, and we‚Äôre iterating quickly to come up with the best approach here. We appreciate all the feedback, and will share more as our work progresses.",14893345
23,"It‚Äôs not just the $8, though ‚Äî this kind of in-app purchase requires bad actors to get through not only Twitter‚Äôs defenses, but also those of mobile device manufacturers and payment processors. That‚Äôs not impossible for a sophisticated adversary ‚Äî but it‚Äôs hard to do at scale.",14893345
24,"Proof-of-humanness is more straightforward. Most spam-fighting is a numbers game: Your objective is to raise the costs on spammers until their losses exceed their gains. When you do that, the spammers go away, and you win. $8 per account raises the costs of spam A LOT.",14893345
25,"For years, Verification on Twitter has been tricky because it‚Äôs a signal both of authenticity (you are who you say you are) and notability (you‚Äôre ‚Äúimportant‚Äù by some standard). 

Notability is inherently difficult to determine in a fair way globally. I support getting rid of it.",14893345
26,"Long-term, I think we need to invest more in identity verification as a complement to proof-of-humanness. Paid Verification is a strong (not perfect) signal of humanness, which helps fight bots and spam. But that‚Äôs not the same thing as identity verification.",14893345
27,"We‚Äôre particularly focused on the risks of impersonation of public officials in the context of the US 2022 midterm elections, and have made the decision not to launch Verification for Twitter Blue until after Election Day.",14893345
28,"In the short term, we‚Äôll ramp up proactive review of Blue Verified accounts that show signs of impersonating another user. When we find them, we‚Äôll suspend them. See something that looks off? You can report it directly in the app.",14893345
29,The planned changes to Twitter Blue to make Verification more widely available raise the stakes for this kind of impersonation. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to do about it:,14893345
30,When Verified accounts use impersonation as a tactic ‚Äî whether for parody or not ‚Äî it creates an especially confusing experience. It‚Äôs been our long-standing practice to suspend Verified users when they do this.,14893345
31,"Parody has long been recognized as an important form of speech, and we have clear, long-standing guidelines about how to operate parody accounts on Twitter in a non-misleading way: https://t.co/A2lHpnPX31",14893345
32,"First, impersonation has always been banned on Twitter. Misleading profiles make Twitter worse for everyone. Last year, we banned more than half a million accounts for impersonating people and brands. https://t.co/rc8ejsISTS",14893345
33,"Verification! Impersonation! Twitter Blue! There‚Äôs a lot going on around identity on Twitter ‚Äî let‚Äôs break down what our policies are, and some of the big questions we still need to answer‚Ä¶",14893345
34,@MikeIsaac @lrozen @darth Agree. A human reviewer would not designate that tweet abusive or a violation of our rules. We use a higher-recall ML approach in this context to automate. It's not perfect.,14893345

63,"@chrismessina Probably not by itself. There's lots of research that suggests confirmed, real-name identity isn't the answer to online abuse (https://t.co/7yDYfxLiJO). But making it harder for bad actors to spin up new accounts can certainly help.",14893345

84,"@C_Kavanagh @ErikN_NJEdition @Egypxican @_Apost8 @JohnRWoodJr @lexfridman @GurusPod Yeah, I never said otherwise. But I still do think the merits of the idea itself take precedent over whatever judgments I have of the source.",564051181

39,"19) Once upon a time--a month ago--FTX was a valuable enterprise.

FTX had ~$10-15b of daily volume, and roughly $1b of annual revenue.  $40b of equity value.

And we were held as paragons of running an effective company.",1110877798820777986
40,18) Truth and Beauty,1110877798820777986
41,"17) I know you've all seen this, but here's where things stand today, roughly speaking.  [LOTS OF CAVEATS, ETC.]

Liquid: -$8b
Semi: +$5.5b
Illiquid: +$3.5b

And yeah, maybe that $9b illiquid M2M isn't worth $9b (+$1b net).

OTOH--a month ago it was worth $18b; +$10b net.

---",1110877798820777986
42,"16) Maybe I'll fail.  Maybe I won't get anything more for customers than what's already there.

I've certainly failed before.  You all know that now, all too well.

But all I can do is to try.  I've failed enough for the month.

And part of me thinks I might get somewhere.",1110877798820777986
43,"15) A few weeks ago, FTX was handling ~$10b/day of volume and billions of transfers.

But there was too much leverage--more than I realized.  A run on the bank and market crash exhausted liquidity.

So what can I try to do?  Raise liquidity, make customers whole, and restart.",1110877798820777986
44,"14) My goal:

a) Clean up and focus on transparency
b) Make customers whole",1110877798820777986
45,"13) My goal‚Äîmy one goal‚Äîis to do right by customers.

I‚Äôm contributing what I can to doing so.  I‚Äôm meeting in-person with regulators and working with the teams to do what we can for customers.

And after that, investors.  But first, customers.",1110877798820777986
46,"12) To the best of my knowledge, as of post-11/7, with the potential for errors:

a) Alameda had more assets than liabilities M2M (but not liquid!)
b) Alameda had margin position on FTX Intl
c) FTX US had enough to repay all customers

Not everyone necessarily agrees with this",1110877798820777986

I will, soon, write up a more complete post on the play by play, but I want to make sure that I get it right when I do.",1110877798820777986
59,4) I'm going to work on giving clarity on where things are in terms of user recovery ASAP.,1110877798820777986

Ultimately I'm optimistic that Mr. Ray and others can help provide whatever is best.",1110877798820777986
61,"2) I'm really sorry, again, that we ended up here.

Hopefully things can find a way to recover.  Hopefully this can bring some amount of transparency, trust, and governance to them.

Ultimately hopefully it can be better for customers.",1110877798820777986
62,"1) Hi all:

Today, I filed FTX, FTX US, and Alameda for voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings in the US.",1110877798820777986
63,"@BillAckman @FTX_Official I deeply appreciate this.  I'm going to keep fighting, as best I can, for users.",1110877798820777986
64,"We hope this is just step one: beginning to find ways to bring liquidity to users.

That is the core thing that I am fighting for right now, and will continue to fight for in whatever ways I can. https://t.co/pzTJBsytVS",1110877798820777986
65,"22) And, finally:

I sincerely apologize.

We'll keep sharing updates as we have them.",1110877798820777986
66,"21) NOT ADVICE, OF ANY KIND, IN ANY WAY

I WAS NOT VERY CAREFUL WITH MY WORDS HERE, AND DO NOT MEAN ANY OF THEM IN A TECHNICAL OR LEGAL SENSE; I MAY WELL HAVE NOT DESCRIBED THINGS RIGHT though I'm trying to be transparent.  I'M NOT A GOOD DEV AND PROBABLY MISDESCRIBED SOMETHING.",1110877798820777986
67,"20) At some point I might have more to say about a particular sparring partner, so to speak.

But you know, glass houses.  So for now, all I'll say is:

well played; you won.",1110877798820777986
68,"19) A few other assorted comments:

This was about FTX International.  FTX US, the US based exchange that accepts Americans, was not financially impacted by this shitshow.

It's 100% liquid.  Every user could fully withdraw (modulo gas fees etc).

Updates on its future coming.",1110877798820777986
69,18) But all of that isn't what matters right now--what matters right now is trying to do right by customers.  That's it.,1110877798820777986
70,"17) All of the stakeholders would have a hard look at FTX governance.  I will not be around if I'm not wanted.

All of the stakeholders--investors, regulators, users--would have a large part to play in how it would be run.

Solely trust.",1110877798820777986
71,"16) Second, in any scenario in which FTX continues operating, its first priority will be radical transparency--transparency it probably always should have been giving.

Giving as close to on-chain transparency as it can: so that people know  *exactly* what is happening on it.",1110877798820777986
72,"15) First, one way or another, Alameda Research is winding down trading.

They aren't doing any of the weird things that I see on Twitter--and nothing large at all.  And one way or another, soon they won't be trading on FTX anymore.",1110877798820777986
73,"14) So, what does this mean going forward?

I'm not sure--that depends on what happens over the next week.

But here are some things I know.",1110877798820777986
74,"13) Because at the end of the day, I was CEO, which means that *I* was responsible for making sure that things went well.  *I*, ultimately, should have been on top of everything.

I clearly failed in that.  I'm sorry.",1110877798820777986
75,"12) Every penny of that--and of the existing collateral--will go straight to users, unless or until we've done right by them.

After that, investors--old and new--and employees who have fought for what's right for their career, and who weren't responsible for any of the fuck ups.",1110877798820777986
76,"11) There are a number of players who we are in talks with, LOIs, term sheets, etc.

We'll see how that ends up.",1110877798820777986
77,"10) So, right now, we're spending the week doing everything we can to raise liquidity.

I can't make any promises about that.  But I'm going to try.  And give anything I have to if that will make it work.",1110877798820777986
78,"9) Anyway: right now, my #1 priority--by far--is doing right by users.

And I'm going to do everything I can to do that.  To take responsibility, and do what I can.",1110877798820777986
79,"8) And so we are where we are.  Which sucks, and that's on me.

I'm sorry.",1110877798820777986
80,"7) And so I was off twice.

Which tells me a lot of things, both specifically and generally, that I was shit at.

And a third time, in not communicating enough.  I should have said more.  I'm sorry--I was slammed with things to do and didn't give updates to you all.",1110877798820777986
81,"6) My sense before:

Leverage: 0x
USD liquidity ready to deliver: 24x average daily withdrawals

Actual:

Leverage: 1.7x
Liquidity: 0.8x Sunday's withdrawals

Because, of course, when it rains, it pours.  We saw roughly $5b of withdrawals on Sunday--the largest by a huge margin.",1110877798820777986
82,"5) The full story here is one I'm still fleshing out every detail of, but as a very high level, I fucked up twice.

The first time, a poor internal labeling of bank-related accounts meant that I was substantially off on my sense of users' margin.  I thought it was way lower.",1110877798820777986
83,"4) FTX International currently has a total market value of assets/collateral higher than client deposits (moves with prices!).

But that's different from liquidity for delivery--as you can tell from the state of withdrawals.  The liquidity varies widely, from very to very little.",1110877798820777986
84,"3) So here's an update on where things are.

[THIS IS ALL ABOUT FTX INTERNATIONAL, THE NON-US EXCHANGE.  FTX US USERS ARE FINE!]

[TREAT ALL OF THESE NUMBERS AS ROUGH.  THERE ARE APPROXIMATIONS HERE.]",1110877798820777986
85,"2) I also should have been communicating more very recently.

Transparently--my hands were tied during the duration of the possible Binance deal; I wasn't particularly allowed to say much publicly.  But of course it's on me that we ended up there in the first place.",1110877798820777986
86,"1) I'm sorry.  That's the biggest thing.

I fucked up, and should have done better.",1110877798820777986

91,3) But the important thing is that customers are protected.,1110877798820777986
92,2) Our teams are working on clearing out the withdrawal backlog as is. This will clear out liquidity crunches; all assets will be covered 1:1. This is one of the main reasons we‚Äôve asked Binance to come in. It may take a bit to settle etc. -- we apologize for that.,1110877798820777986
