the title to the song ATOPOS is inspired by what roland barthes describes so magnificently in his book “a lover’s discourse”

it is about the unclassifiable OTHER , the one which we love or hate , who is the OTHER ? https://t.co/ObQsiWnlx9",8236062
47,"https://t.co/CMtfh5QuXZ
here is the first video of my album to the song “atopos”

“our differences are irrelevant
our union is stronger than us”
